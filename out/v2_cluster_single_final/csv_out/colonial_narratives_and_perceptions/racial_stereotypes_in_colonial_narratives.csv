63,Colonial narratives depicting African societies as barbaric and uncivilized were used to justify European intervention and military expeditions in Africa.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view supporting the claim that colonial narratives depicting African societies as barbaric and uncivilized were used to justify European intervention and military expeditions in Africa. The textbook highlights the pervasive European belief in cultural and racial superiority, institutionalized through colonial policies and the League of Nations' mandates system, which portrayed Africans as ""childlike"" or ""non-adult,"" necessitating European ""tutelage"" and intervention. It references European historians who claimed Africa had no history before European arrival, reinforcing the notion of African societies as stagnant and uncivilized. Missionaries, often seen as agents of colonialism, justified intervention as a morally righteous endeavor to civilize and develop Africa, rationalizing the imposition of European cultural norms and suppression of African cultural expressions. Similarly, The African Times articles frequently describe African societies in terms of savagery and barbarism, highlighting practices like cannibalism and human sacrifice to argue for European intervention. They emphasize the necessity of European governance to bring about meaningful change, contrasting African ""barbarism"" with the civilizing mission of European powers, framing intervention as a moral duty. However, the articles also include critical perspectives on European actions, such as the negative impact of the liquor trade and exploitation for capitalist interests, complicating the narrative of a purely benevolent mission. Together, these sources illustrate how colonial narratives were constructed to legitimize European dominance and exploitation in Africa.","The ""General History of Africa"" textbook provides several details that support the claim that colonial narratives depicting African societies as barbaric and uncivilized were used to justify European intervention and military expeditions in Africa.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.716, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Both statements suggest that paternalistic attitude which had thoroughly permeated European thought about colonial Africa and which was both internationalized and institutionalized with the mandates system that emerged from the League of Nations after the First World War. In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory. In retrospect, the period can clearly be seen as the one in which the bureaucratization of colonial administration occurred."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.682, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and jingoism to hear it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.707, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Most missionaries were of the firm persuasion that if there was to be European intervention, then it should come from their own countries. As Roland Oliver wrote, 'They wished to ensure that the intervention would be carried out by their own countrymen or by the power most likely to offer the best opportunity for the work of their denominations.' 5 Moreover, colonial government in Africa, most missionaries argued, would not only provide the much desired security and protection which would assist them in redressing the evils of the slave trade, but would also stimulate and guarantee the development of new economic opportunities for the Africans.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

In fact, African reactions were the very reverse. It is quite evident that Africans were faced with only two options, either to readily surrender their sovereignty and independence, or to defend them at all costs. It is most significant that the great majority of them, as will be amply demonstrated in this volume, irrespective of the political and socio-economic structures of their states and in the face of all the odds against them, did decide to defend their sovereignty and independence. The weight of the odds against them on the one hand and the strength of the determination to resist at any price on the other are both captured by the relief reproduced on the jacket of this volume. This relief, painted on one of the walls of the palace of the kings of Dahomey in Abomey, depicts an African armed with only a bow and arrow defiantly and squarely facing a European armed with a gun.\nJohn D. Hargreaves, for instance, poses this interesting question. Given the: range of possible attitudes on the part of the European invaders, a number of options might be open to African rulers. Among the shortterm advantages obtainable from treaties or from collaboration with Europeans were not merely access to fire-arms and consumer goods, but opportunities to enlist powerful allies in external or internal disputes. Why then did so many African states reject such opportuni› ties, choosing to resist the Europeans in battle? 12 This may sound enigmatic, but only so to somebody looking at the whole issue from a Eurocentric point of view. To the African, the issue at stake was not short-term or long-term advantages but rather the fundamental question of his land and his sovereignty, and it is precisely because of this that virtually all African polities, centralized and non-centralized alike, sooner or later chose to maintain or defend or try to regain their sovereignty. To them, there could be no compromise on that, and indeed many of the leaders of these states chose to die on the battlefield, go into voluntary flight or face exile rather than surrender their sovereignty without a struggle.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'A common pattern of the movement of cultural forms and their concrete manifestations, the incident provides an apt model of survival, even renewal of cultural values in the face of religious and other more socially intensive forms of domination.

The slave trade had intensified internecine warfare for over two centuries, leading to cultural devastation on an unprecedented scale. Punitive raids by colonial forces, missionary intolerance and lack of understanding - all these had thoroughly derailed the accustomed cultural directions of the continent. Different methods of foreign control or interaction with the African populace naturally evoked or created different cultural responses from the displaced African. Belgian and Portuguese colonialism, as well as British settler colonialism in East Africa, are easily recognized as the most ruthless on the continent. They created conditions for the truly displaced African in the most literal sense of the word.

This approach fails to consider the prevailing circumstances under which various groups or individuals operated.

It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments.

African responses to the initial impact combined military confrontation with diplomatic efforts in a vain attempt to preserve their independence. Where Africans did not engage in military or diplomatic activity, they acquiesced or remained indifferent, except where direct demands were made on them. The establishment of colonialism meant the reorganization of the political and economic life of the people. Taxes were introduced. Forced labour and general deprivation of political rights were practised. Some Africans responded to these changes violently. Others acquiesced. In Tanganyika and Uganda, some Africans had moved to peasant pro› duction of cash crops, particularly cotton and coffee. In Kenya, Africans were denied the production of cash crops.

The uncivilized natives of Africa, like all uncivilized people, look upon a wrecked ship and her cargo as their legitimate prey. Until we know, therefore, all the circumstances connected with this loss of the Sultan of Sockatoo, the cause of her taking the ground, and the attack on her and her crew by the natives, we will not dwell further on last year's proceedings. That they did not, however, have the result of giving security to trading steamers in the River Niger is indisputable. One of the earliest of the steamers up the river this season has come to grief. The native appetite for plunder will be whetted by the spoils they have acquired on this occasion, and increased peril to all steamers ascending the river for purposes of trade will be an inevitable result. The work of devoted missionaries in the Niger countries will avail but little for the progress of Christianity and civilization while the trading relations of Europeans with the natives are in so unsatisfactory a state. In an article on Trade in the Upper Gambia, we referred to this unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Niger, and we think it is a matter for serious consideration on the part of Her Majesty's Government, who are now called upon from time to time to send up ships of war to inflict punishments which do not seem to have any permanent effect in the way of repression, whether this sort of thing is to go on ad infinitum. We certainly fail to see on what grounds Her Majesty's Government deny protection to traders in the Upper Gambia, who would pay import and export duties at Bathurst, and grant it, at great expense and continual risk, to traders in the River Niger, who pay no duties whatever, and who possibly themselves create the necessity for the costly interference of Her Majesty's Government, by violence and wrong toward the natives. The question is full of difficulties, and they are difficulties that must be dealt with. We have no means at present for ascertaining what is the annual amount of trade in the River Niger, and some means ought to be adopted by which such information may be obtained. The late Earl of Clarendon, when at the Foreign Office, made provision for the establishment of a British Consular Authority up the River Niger, and nominated Mr. J. Lyons McLeod, formerly Consul at Mozambique, to the not very desirable post. Her Majesty's present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs abolished this Consulate, on the double ground that the then actual amount of trade in the River Niger was not such as to justify the expense, and that it was not advisable to have a British Consul residing at any place where he could not be protected by Her Majesty's Government without difficulty. We presume that the trade in the River Niger has considerably increased since the period at which Mr. McLeod was recalled and placed on the retired list on such grounds; and if we are also to have annual ascents of the river by Her Majesty's steamers to protect the traders, it would surely be better to re-appoint Mr. McLeod to a Niger Consulate, in order that Her Majesty's Government might have constant reliable information as to the trade in the river, and the way in which it is conducted by the traders; and that there might be some competent authority on the spot to whom difficulties between the natives and the traders could be referred, and by whom they might be authoritatively settled. We are very much disposed to think that by this means the necessity for frequent ascents of the river by Her Majesty's ships of war might be obviated, and peace in the river be so promoted as to lead to a great development of trade, and promote the spread of civilization and Christianity among the natives.""}, {'id': 6820, 'article_title': 'Leaders', 'full_section_title': 'Leaders', 'last_edit_date': '02-04-1897', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1897#article-12', 'issue_date': '04_02_1897', 'content': ""**THE TREACHEROUS CONDUCT** of the king of Benin towards a peaceful mission from the Niger Coast Protectorate has aroused a feeling of horror throughout the civilized world.

This place is situated to the west of the Niger, and some 60 miles up the Benin river, which empties itself into the sea about 130 miles from Akassa. Besides Acting-Consul General Phillips, Major Copland Crawford (Deputy-Commissioner for the Protectorate), and a few other Europeans of note, there were about 150 Kroomen and native carriers composing the expedition, which left Sapele on Jan. 2. Nothing more was heard of it until, about a week or ten days later, the Consul-General's yacht arrived at Bonny with the tidings that the party had been attacked at Gwato by the Benin people, and massacred almost to a man. It appears that the members of the expedition were entirely unarmed, and were at first well received: but a few days later they were set upon by an immense number of Natives who were in ambush, and only two Englishmen and six or seven Natives escaped—and that almost by a miracle. It is almost needless to remark that the next expedition which approaches Benin will be equipped very differently from that which has just been destroyed. The King, a monster of the Prempeh stamp, unless his reputation belies him, must be promptly brought to book for his proceeding.

When I saw that they wanted to murder the man, I had my boat got ready, and was just rushing off, when Mr. Thomson came along in his boat. We pulled hard, but the cruel demons of men had broken the skull and marked the water with the man\'s blood; the poor fellow sunk just as Mr. Thomson was about to stretch out his hand to rescue. When the men in the canoe saw him sink, and that we were too late, they gave a savage shout of triumph. They landed amongst a large crowd of people on the beach; I followed them, and told them of their sin, and that it would be remembered against them.""\n\nIn another letter Mr. Smith continues the narrative: ""The slaves, who are powerful in numbers, were very angry, and banded themselves together the following morning and made an attack on the town, driving the freemen and their masters before them. Those who had committed the deed took shelter on mission-ground. The \'country-fashion,\' or superstition house, was burnt down; nearly all the plantain-trees were destroyed and two men wounded. Much consternation and danger prevailed. We were afraid other depredations would occur. Several headmen from A\'kwa town, myself, and two or three members, went amongst them, and got them, after much difficulty, to retire to their own quarters. Much inconvenience was felt by prohibiting the wives of the freemen going to their farms and obtaining food. Many were their threatenings, and it is a mercy no lives were lost; we were amongst them continually, heard their complaints, and sought to satisfy them. In a few days King A\'kwa returned home, had a meeting, and settled the serious palaver. Had the freemen been equally willing to hear us as were the slaves, they would have saved much suffering and the life of the young man would have been saved also.

Africa, of itself, unaided, is totally incapable of emerging from the cruel barbarism which has been its universal characteristic; and although the process of civilization may be attended by no small amount of evil, that civilization will, when accomplished, bear fruits of human happiness that will afford full compensation.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-01-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.696, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Letters to the Editor: The New Crusade', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—Of all the European Powers, Germany is perhaps the most harsh and tyrannical in its dealings with native tribes, and yet the Government of that country has the effrontery to appeal to the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity"" in justification of its filibustering raid in Eastern Africa. With equal audacity, a French Cardinal has been preaching a crusade of wrath and vengeance in the name of the Prince of Peace, and calling upon Christendom to unite in sending the fiery cross of blood and slaughter amongst the Arabs in Equatorial Africa. The Pope, too, has lent his countenance and support to this bellicose expedition, although he would, no doubt, tell us that the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but spiritual. Then Britain must needs join in the attack by blockading the coast for the benefit of Germany. It may be asked, What all these armed and warlike proceedings are about? Ostensibly for the suppression of the slave trade, but in reality, for the exploitation of Africa in the interests of European capitalists, speculators, and land grabbers. Religious jealousy inspires many of those modern crusaders, for whose encouragement the holy Father will, no doubt, promise the same reward as his predecessors did to the zealots who attempted to wrest Palestine from the Saracens. An eminent traveller has lately borne testimony to the self-sacrificing life and labours of the Arab missionaries in the Dark Continent. Like the early apostles, they go forth without money, scrip, or change of raiment; entering the villages with the salutation of peace, fraternizing with the natives, and dwelling amongst them as friends and instructors. Under their trading whole tribes have abandoned their hereditary fetish worship, their human sacrifices, their cannibal feasts, their abominable obscene rites, and become converts to the faith of Abraham and Mohammed. Whilst Islam thus exerts such an elevating and beneficial influence, it cannot be denied that the African becomes almost always worse for his intercourse with European traders. For every native who falls a victim to the slave trade, how many are consumed by the more accursed liquor traffic, by the vile, poisonous, maddening concoctions introduced by Germans and Englishmen, who talk in such a sanctimonious manner of the ""sacred principles of humanity and Christianity?"" The Arab slave dealer may kill the body, but is not able to kill the soul; whilst this European spirit-seller sends both body and soul to perdition. Again, the captive African, in trading Arabia, is set free when he embraces Islam, and treated as a man and a brother, for ""all true believers are brethren."" In many cases he rises to the highest offices of State, his race and colour being no impediment to his advancement. In what part of Christendom would the same toleration be displayed? The descendants of those who robbed the poor of their patrimony in Reformation times would be horrified at the idea of a negro filling the position of Cabinet Minister, however grand his abilities might be. The professed abhorrence of English society for the institution of slavery can be estimated at its right value by those who remember the sympathy exhibited by the British nobility and gentry for the slave owning oligarchy of the Southern States during the Rebellion. The evils of Arabian slavery are not so bad as those resulting from the system of modern capitalism, and the trade itself is often an obstacle to the capacity of European adventurers, greedy for cheap labour, cheap ivory, and markets into which to shoot cheap home-made goods.', 'last_edit_date': '1888-12-03', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/03_12_1888#article-9', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.692, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'COPY OF THE REPORT OF COL.

They are far from being the stupid race we so often hear them called. Keen at a bargain, they are often a match for some of us in that boasted Yankee trait. Apt to learn, quick to understand and to appreciate advantages, they are a people easy to assume and appropriate the best results of civilization—brave in the defence of their rights and homes, yet not aggressive, except when forced by circumstances and their teachings. We forget the whole history of this people in looking only at some particular phase or trait. Their land, the field of the slave-stealer for centuries, has been the scene of cruelty, fraud, and all the worst forms of vice. A people educated by so long a course of schooling in its vicissitudes might well be cruel and vicious. The land has been hunted, from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope, by foreign and native stealers. Tribes have been driven for self-protection, or by greed of gain, to make captures from other tribes or other parts of their own. To show the debasing power of slavery and slave-hunting, let me say that I have seen slaves brought to the coast from the central parts of Africa who were the most abject specimens of the human race I have ever known—brought by a strong, stalwart tribe, noble in bearing, and brave in war; and these, too, were the same tribe or people only a comparatively short time before. Why this great difference? A simple explanation is only required to show it all. Together and at peace, they had a generous and varied diet of animal and vegetable food, for they had extent of territory in which to hunt and gather; but divided and at war, fighting for self-protection, one party gained the supremacy. Then the other were a defeated people; circumscribed within small limits, unable to hunt, they were soon confined to vegetable diet alone, and then to a single kind, and often to a few simple roots; courage gone, they were reduced to servitude and slavery, and brought to a market.

But with this exception, how deplorable was the condition of mankind universally. The only existent civilization, that of the countries under the Roman sway, was a civilization of violence and slavery—a civilization that included most degrading superstitions, and excesses at the record of which all Christian people shudder. Beyond the limits of Roman dominion all was darker still. Cruel superstitions everywhere prevailed, and the whole earth was full of violence and blood. It is not our purpose to recapitulate; we merely appeal to the broad and well-known facts of history. We will just glance, however, at one that touches us most nearly—the fact of the condition of the greater portion of Europe—of what is now France, Germany, Britain. Lands of forests and swamps, roadless as the African bush, inhabited for the most part by naked populations, whose bodies were protected and ornamented by fat and paint, upon the altars of whose false gods human victims were offered—human blood was constantly flowing! Need we say more? True, these people were of fair complexion, and so beautiful, that captives from among them carried to Rome excited general admiration. But with this difference, what is there in the state and condition of Africa and the African people that could not have found a parallel in the state and condition of these now most highly-favoured countries and peoples? Nothing really. Evil ruled in them as as it rules now in Africa, and it produced there fruits that attend its sway everywhere, and which make the greater portion of native Africa so loathsome. These countries emerged from their barbarism. How? By their own unaided effort? No. The pre-existing civilising agencies, imperfect and corrupt though they were, were brought to bear upon them. The Romans formed high military roads through them. Successive invasions, military colonies, the influence of new inhabitants, worked gradual changes. And then the great and glorious life-giving light of Christianity came in with its mighty transforming powers. Look at Europe now. It is far from being all that a Christian would desire. But even those among its favoured peoples who profess to scorn and contemn Christianity are greatly under the controlling influence of its precepts, because the civilization which prevails and governs, though still an imperfect one, is, nevertheless, a Christian civilization.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1864#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.683, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The tragedy of the gifted poet from Madagascar, Jean-Joseph RabØarivelo (??-i937) who committed suicide through his - it was believed - failure to resolve this internal wrench in his colonial psyche, was a dramatic example. This gave a discernible ambiguous quality to the writings of many articulate Africans in the early period of colonial affirmation. It facilitated the policy of cultural assimilation, especially in the French, Portuguese and Spanish territories, resulting in the deliberate withdrawal from, even denial of the authentic sources of African creative genius by the new elite.

Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D.

When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

It is true Governor Blackall, who _looked at them from the deck of his steamboat_, tells them, ""Fear not, I will protect you,"" and so on, but meanwhile he leaves them to the tender mercies of marauding savage tribes fighting in their immediate neighbourhood, cut off from all assistance and protection except what can be afforded by ten policemen. Would not any reasonable and humane man—any man not an official—any man having the honour of Great Britain at heart, say that it would be better to employ a portion of the colonial funds in raising and supporting a local corps for the defence of the island, instead of keeping up a lazy staff of officials who have little or nothing to do, save smoke cigars and drink brandy until they get invalided or become alcoholic victims of _African climate!_ You shall hear again by July mail.—Yours,'}, {'id': 1297, 'article_title': 'A Sentimental Journey on the West Coast of Africa', 'full_section_title': 'A Sentimental Journey on the West Coast of Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1868#article-28', 'issue_date': '23_03_1868', 'content': '(Written by a Thinking Man, while carried by four Strong-smelling Men.

I was a long time a-doing it. I did not observe the time, having an idea that it was not the right time although I am writing about that to the Times; you will say this is very wrong. I have also been taught since my earliest days that time was made for slaves, and have also been taught that ""Britons never will be slaves,"" though they are as a rule in a tremendous state of bondage (slaves to their own passions); there is nothing in Africa approaching to it except the same thing. Well, anyhow, I did finally get into my hammock. In passing the castle I proudly reared my head at the thought that old England owned such a structure; in doing this I hit my head against the hammock pole, so I laid down again and smiled as if it did not hurt. Now, I said to my brave bearers and followers, ""Marchons,"" and so we marched on.\n\nCHAPTER II.—THE JOURNEY ITSELF.\n\nAs I passed through the town I glanced benevolently at everybody, but they did not seem to mind that; the old story about mind and matter flashed through my brain and made me feel a little better. In the suburbs I did not observe much. The suburbs of Cape Coast Castle have always had a peculiar effect on me. I take out my pocket handkerchief and hold my nose and shut my eyes, so that I am not prepared to say what I thought of them; having a regard for people\'s delicate feelings. If the inhabitants of Cape Coast are proud of their suburbs it is all well. If it is not all well there are a good many wells, but we will leave well alone and pass onward. Talking of passes, I came to several pretty passes—I think things have in general—I also passed through a gorge which I thought gorgeous, but I did not say so because I thought the hammock-men might drop me if I did. I now began to study the peculiarities of hammock-men as a class, and why they generally converse about eating and drinking (I have good authority for what I here state). It then suddenly occurred to me that I had forgotten to bring\n**111**\n\n---'}, {'id': 1752, 'article_title': 'Interesting Account of the Pangwes of Equatorial Africa', 'full_section_title': 'Interesting Account of the Pangwes of Equatorial Africa', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_02_1870#article-29', 'issue_date': '23_02_1870', 'content': ""The first visit that was ever made to one of their settlements by a white man was by one of our missionaries, who sickened and died a few days after his return, and the King of the Pangwes, whom he visited, died about the same time. This added to their superstitious fears, and rendered it difficult for us to gain access to them, and especially to have any communication with their chiefs and kings. The tribes residing on the rivers also persistently opposed our passing through their country to visit those beyond them, lest it might in some way interfere with their trade or other selfish interests. After several fruitless attempts to visit those located upon the upper sources of the Gaboon, I determined to attempt the exploration of the Asango, a northern branch of the river, near the head of which I had learned a Pangwe settlement was being established. But as soon as my purpose was announced, discouragements were raised on every side. That branch of the tribe was represented as being particularly savage; that, never having seen a white person, they would be sure to kill and eat the first one who should fall into their hands.\n\nHaving with some difficulty secured a boat's crew, accompanied by a young missionary recently arrived from America, I ascended the river to a Shékanié town, near the mouth of the stream we desired to explore. Here, after considerable delay and palaver, and by the promise of a liberal reward, we obtained the services of the headman to go with us as guide and interpreter. About midnight, with the upturning tide, we entered the Asango, and rapidly pursued our way, the sound of our oars re-echoing from the dense mangrove jungles that lined both sides of the river. The darkness of the night, the stillness and solitude of the scene, unbroken save by the noise of...\n\nour boat, the chirping of insects, and the occasional barking of a chimpanzee, gorilla, or other denizen of the forest, was sufficiently novel to keep us wakeful till the dawn, which we welcomed with joy. In the course of the morning we passed two or three Bakélie towns, the inhabitants of which did all in their power to dissuade us from going further; and, when they perceived that their threats and appeals to our fears were unavailing, some of the women who had come down to the river-side raised the death wailing, as much as to say they regarded us as already dead. Further on the stream became narrower, with higher banks, and the mangrove trees were exchanged for other and larger giants of the forest, which towered so high and spread their leafy branches so wide as nearly to screen us from the light and heat of the sun. We saw several places were the banks were broken by the tracks of elephants, which had come to bathe or cross the river, and at last we reached a landing-place where were marks of human footsteps.""}, {'id': 1776, 'article_title': 'Incidents of the Slave-trade in Egypt', 'full_section_title': 'Incidents of the Slave-trade in Egypt', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_03_1870#article-23', 'issue_date': '23_03_1870', 'content': '""Entering the court of the building, we were met by a dirty, but rather polite Arab, who conducted us upstairs for a look at his property.

In their indigenous state, they had a name for God; but of his nature and attributes, like all unenlightened pagans, they were in woeful ignorance. Circumcision prevailed among them, and some other traditions and customs that seem to have been derived from a Jewish origin. Their superstitions seem not to differ materially from those of the tribes nearer the coast; though I rejoice to learn that their belief in witchcraft is not so general and sanguinary in its influence as among the neighbouring tribes. They lead their persons with a variety of charms and fetishes, which they profess to believe are possessed of potent power to secure to them good and protect them from evil; and the manufacture and sale of these to other tribes, not excepting the semi-civilised Mpongwes, is a large and profitable business. Like the proud Athenians of old, ""they are in all things too superstitious."" Every appearance in nature and event in Providence, which is beyond their comprehension, they consider supernatural. A company of them was once standing upon the piazza of our house, watching the oscillations of the pendulum of a clock that was visible in the room. They supposed it was a spirit. Opening the clock, I endeavoured to explain the mystery to them, and invited them to approach nearer, which they declined to do. Presently the hour of twelve arrived, and the clock commenced striking, when they fled precipitately, and could not be persuaded to return.

I have more than once been requested by the chiefs and people now under French rule to write on their behalf to the English Government to take possession of their country, in order to prevent the French from doing so, as they foresaw inevitably would be the case in the ordinary course of events, and as has now come to pass.\n\nThe Gaboon settlement or territory, with its dependencies, extends from about 50 min. north latitude to 2 deg. south latitude, and includes not only the Gaboon proper, but also Cape Lopez and the rivers Mexias, Fernan Vas, and Ogowé; the latter, although so little known to European geographers, being the great artery of, and most direct highway into, Equatorial Africa. I have myself explored its course for a distance of nearly 300 miles from its mouth, and at my furthest point the natives are completely ignorant of its source or origin, which may probably be looked for in one of the vast central lakes, if, indeed, it be not the long-sought outlet of Tanganyika, which Lieutenant Cameron is supposed to have lately discovered, and is now exploring to the sea. As far as is yet known, its course lies directly under the Equator, and this fine river runs through a region rich in ivory, india-rubber, ebony, and other products of great value, the Gaboon ivory being well known as the finest in the world; whilst the climate is very good for West Africa, and infinitely better than that of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, or Lagos. The estuary of the Gaboon is the safest and most commodious harbour on the whole West Coast, easily accessible to ships of the largest class, and wherein thousands of vessels could ride at anchor at the same time. The trade of Gaboon, as also that of Grand Bassam, is already chiefly in the hands of British traders, whilst that of the Gambia is principally in the hands of French merchants or, to speak more correctly, the produce of the latter river goes almost entirely to France, where it is utilized, but has never been so in England.'}, {'id': 3449, 'article_title': 'A Brave and Good Young Englishman', 'full_section_title': 'A Brave and Good Young Englishman', 'last_edit_date': '09-07-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1877#article-23', 'issue_date': '01_11_1877', 'content': '\n\nAbout nine o\'clock p.m. on the 24th of last month, a report was brought to Mr. P. M. Van de Poel, agent to Messrs. Alexander Miller Brothers and Co., that a native gentleman\'s (by name Geraldo de Lima) house had been robbed; and as he is always on the alert, he at once took his rifle and went to see if the report was true. On entering he was met by three men, one of them striking him a heavy blow on the chest to make him fall down. He got up, and fired his rifle after the men, but, because of the uncertain light, he missed them. He then went into the house, and found another, whom he captured and put in chains. He found they had taken about 250l. worth of goods, and Geraldo was away in Accra, at law with G. B. Williams. He then went to Denoo Town, about one mile away; and although it was about midnight, he himself went into any of the houses he suspected, and made the people get out of bed and find lights for him to search their house. In this way he found some of the stolen property. The natives might easily have killed him, and nobody known anything about it, the nearest white man being at Quittah, nearly a day\'s journey from here; but he did not fear. The property he found he gave to the chief of the town till he should find more. Early next day he heard that one of the thieves was in Rajenawa. So he called Koko Mensa, the chief of that place, and told him he wanted to capture a man in his town; and as the chief agreed, he, after a lot of trouble, captured him. Then he went to Denoo again, and found another; and as the people would not allow him to capture him, he coaxed them to bring him to his factory, so that he might tell him some palaver. When he got him there, he seized him, and put him in chains, with his thief brothers. Denoo people then went away, but about ten o\'clock p.m. they came, about one hundred or more strong, all armed with clubs, swords, and knives, and demanded the release of their people. But Mr. Van de Poel refused, and strongly told them he would never give them up. Denoo people then formed round him, and tried to take the men by force: but they do not know white men. He flogged them with his fists, not caring for their knives, clubs, &c., and marked some badly, and repulsed them. His boy wanted to bring his rifle, but he said, ""No; his hands would suffice."" Then they began to overpower him, and he ran and got a big keg of powder, and broke it open with his foot, and put a stick in palm-oil, and lighted it, holding it close to the powder. The Denoo people ran away; but they met plenty of friends coming to help Mr. Van de Poel, and when they saw the powder was put away, they came back, and Mr. Van de Poel\'s friends asked for guns to be served out; but he refused, saying, ""The first man that touches Denoo people I will flog. The palaver belongs to me, and I alone will show them I am master."" So white man will do for black man. So Denoo people formed again, and succeeded in getting the men in chains out of the house; Mr. Van de Poel not letting us interfere. He ran out, and caught hold of the chain, and one of Denoo people stabbed him in the hand. Then he said, ""Now it is time to do something;"" so he fought hard in the middle of the people, until he got to the house and got his rifle. But his friends held him, and with much trouble got the rifle; but he seized a leaden bar and run out to the people, and dragged the prisoners back into the house. Then the old men came to beg; but he drove them away, calling them ""curs,"" ""sheep,"" ""foxes,"" ""thieves,"" ""brutes,"" ""rascals,"" ""cowards,"" &c., and that they went away. Next day he went alone to town, and called them the same names, and they begged his pardon, and confessed him to be master, and that he was in the right.'}, {'id': 3586, 'article_title': 'Letter of Merchants and Traders to Governor Rowe', 'full_section_title': 'Letter of Merchants and Traders to Governor Rowe', 'last_edit_date': '03-15-1878', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1878#article-8', 'issue_date': '01_05_1878', 'content': 'Sir,—Your Excellency having already been informed by the chiefs and traders of the Boom River that war has recently broken out there, it is needless for us to again enter into particulars concerning the same.

The meeting that was held on Sunday last by the Hunsiqueen and Befar people, summoning all merchants and traders, was simply because merchants import salt. It is customary here—i.e., on the West Coast of Africa—that whenever a meeting is to be held, the Cabocceer staff is to be presented, showing that the chief is in the midst of his subjects. But this meeting was not thus. They never called Hévê, and Abomakey, the latter being the capital where the Cabocceer resides. Now, Mr. Editor, ""Hévê"" people intend to make a fence, shutting the Padah and Whydah people from coming to negotiate with us—the only means that we depend upon. Are we to fold our hands and sit down and make expenses with other people\'s property? The Cabocceer wanted duty from us. Cannot common sense tell these people what the future will bring on their heads? Mr. Turnbull sent a message once to the Cabocceer, saying ""It is of no use bothering me for duty; unless the fence be removed out of Hunsiqueen, not a cowrie will be given to you as duty."" These people have drunk plenty of our rum, now they intend to fool us; but as long as you live, we hope protection will surely be given to us.

In case of a formal refusal we cannot force a passage, but shall be obliged to turn to the unknown south, probably inhabited by savage and independent tribes, and penetrate to Baghirmi and Borun, the character of whose inhabitants is said to be much better than those of Bargu, who are very bad and unsubmissive to their sovereign.

Commander V. L. Cameron, who is at this present moment on the Gold Coast, in company with Captain R. F. Burton, has told us that last year, when surveying the Akankoo concession, he worked for days together up to his middle in water, and lived! Captain Burton himself, in a letter written in February last to the directors of the Guinea Coast Gold Mining Company, speaking of Apollonia, says ""During the hot hours the doctor—that is, the sea breeze—blows freshly; the evening temperature is delicious, and during the cool dewy nights we found blankets necessary.""\n\nI visited all the mines then being worked, and saw upwards of thirty Europeans, of various nationalities, who both worked and lived. I also saw very large numbers of natives, as well as several hundreds of Kroomen, who worked regularly, both day and night, at the mines, and in transporting heavy machinery and other goods from Axim to the different mines at and near Takwah. I travelled partly by hammock, partly by boat and canoe, as well as on foot, over Wassaw, Egwira, Apollonia, Axim, and Apatim, meeting hundreds of native carriers transporting provisions, pieces of heavy machinery, and other articles, by road and river, without overseers, and by whose means, aided by Kroomen, everything now at the mines had been carried there, with little loss by accident or theft. I slept in native huts without doors or fastenings; and at Axim, my bedroom door and windows remained open day and night; yet the whole extent of my loss by theft, during six months, was one plated table-fork stolen on board a steam launch! Surely this does not look as though the ""natives cannot be induced to work,"" or that ""the people are debased beyond conception."" On the contrary, having visited most places between Gorée and the Congo, I am happy to state that I found the natives of the Western Province of the Gold Coast Colony exceptionally honest for negroes. As to work, we all know that the negro has no abstract love of labour, but he can and will work for gain—and work well. Moreover whenever it may become necessary, Coolies in any number can be imported from China and India, and this is already under consideration.\n\nRoads can be made, and kept in order, where the traffic is sufficiently great to counteract the rapidity of vegetable growth incidental to a tropical climate; and here again I may quote Captain Burton\'s letter, in which he says: ""A good line was cut from the village to the concession.

The country he travelled though is called ""Makonde,"" or the country of bushes and creepers, which from one end to the other is one dense mass of tangled vegetation, over which a person might struggle for several miles without ever touching the ground. After some days\' hard marching he reached the Lujendi river and went on to the Mavitu village of Itulo, where the coal was said to exist. They soon discovered that this was merely a few irregular layers of bituminous shale of no value as fuel. He went on to a place called Kwamahanja, where the coal was said to be specially abundant, but here he had no better success. At this place there is a fine cataract. On his way homeward he ascended the isolated mountain named Lipumbula, rising like a huge broken column from the surrounding plain, which proved to be a compact mass of granite 1,805 feet above the level of the sea, and 905 above the surrounding plain. After seven weeks\' travelling he reached the coast a little south of Cape Delgado, after a journey of from 600 to 700 miles. The Makonde people he describes as very ugly, and tattooed in the most inartistic style, not for colour, but to make raised marks. The women wear a circular piece of wood variously carved in the upper lip, commonly 2 inches in diameter, and suggesting the idea of a duck\'s bill. The slave-trade, though not altogether destroyed, was much altered, slaves having become so much more valuable that they were much better cared for. The stoppage of the sea traffic had thus to a large extent stopped the progress of the land transit. The most energetic and industrious people in East Africa are the Wahyas, to which tribe belong the well-known Chuma and all the best free porters to be had.

A. Verminck. This is incorrect, and I refer any one who desires to dispute what I say to the charges in the court books, as read to the jury. The first charge was for stealing or embezzling 8 tons 8 cwt. of nuts. The second charge was for stealing or embezzling 15 tons of nuts. Thus, one might say Owens was charged for stealing or embezzling about 23 tons of nuts; but any one who said Owens was tried for stealing hundreds of tons of nuts states something which is clearly untrue. Twenty-three tons of nuts, even to the most excited imagination, can never be hundreds of tons of produce. He then goes on to say Owens was a native of good family from the Bambarra country, thus leading strangers to suppose that Owens is a half-civilized man from the Bambarra country. The truth is, Owens\' father and himself were born here, and have occupied positions of great responsibility with credit; his forefathers, I believe, came from the Bambarra country. So much for this insinuation. My next extract is, ""Owens had vessels sent up to him by E. Thomas, in which he shipped hundreds of tons of produce, which were sold by E. Thomas for Owens."" The sworn evidence of Mamadoo, Owens\' half-brother, given at the trial, proves that he (Mamadoo) was the party that did this business, and as the prosecutor could not disprove this, and as Mr. Owens was neither prosecuted nor accused on such a score, what right has ""Lynx"" to insinuate that such was part of the case against Mr. Owens, save to injure him in the eyes of the public and the next jury who will have to try the case? Is this not unfair, and does not a man who can write thus merit the deepest reprobation? The next fact of your correspondent is, ""Mr. Owens had a large cutter built, in the name of his brother, at McCarthy\'s Island, the materials being purchased with a portion of the proceeds of the nuts. But this cutter was not mentioned at the trial."" If ""Lynx"" was present at the trial he must have known, for it was proved by evidence, that this cutter was built by Owens\' half-brother, Mamadoo, from materials purchased with his own money, and not from the proceeds of the nuts. This is a fact which ""Lynx"" has either ignored or suppressed.

The following narrative of the disaster, and the treatment endured by passengers and crew at the hands of the natives, is from the account of the Rev. Mr. Roe, who with his wife was on board the Corisco, on their voyage out as missionaries. The wreck was caused by striking on a sunken rock; it was about 4 a.m., when all but the watch were in their berths. The morning was very dark, rain descending in torrents. The shock was terrific, the vessel being shaken so that everyone on board, asleep or awake, was aware that something awful had happened. Captain Porter was out in an instant, and ordered all hands on deck, going speedily to the saloon to see that all the passengers got out. He next ordered the boats out, and stood by the bulwarks in the coolest manner, seeing that his instructions were obeyed. The ladies were first put into the boats, then their husbands, afterwards the remainder of the passengers, and lastly the members of the crew. Boat after boat was got out with remarkable correctness and rapidity, and the crew took their allotted places. In about twenty minutes everybody was in the boats, the last to leave the ship being the Captain. The vessel, in the meantime, was gradually sinking, her decks being level with the sea when she was abandoned. The weather was squally, the surf bad, and great difficulty was experienced in getting clear. The steamer was furnished with five surf-boats, which probably prevented any loss of life. Mrs. Roe had a narrow escape, as during the time she was being lowered into the boat the vessel gave a lurch, and the poor lady's hand was caught between the rope and the side of the ship. She was, however, got safely into the boat. In the interim the news of the disaster spread to the shore, and hundreds of natives came off in their canoes. These were perfect savages, and the Corisco had scarcely been abandoned when her decks were literally covered with men, who plundered everything they could possibly carry away. They did not molest the passengers and crew, although one fellow attempted to enter one of the boats, but a member of the crew threatened to kill him with an axe. Captain Porter, knowing the savage nature of the natives of the district, forbade any of the boats going to the shore until inquiries had been made.

My experience of these people may be briefly stated. What I have seen of them I like, and after two years spent in their midst, I see no cause for apprehension that the security of the new State will be threatened by its black subjects. My reasons for this opinion are twofold. First, the character of the people; second, their tribal formation. If asked to define their general character, I should reply that I considered them a negative race. They possess neither gratitude, affection, nor courage. Nor did I find among them the vicious kind of vices. They are not naturally cruel; they are not, as a rule, treacherous; if punished justly, they bear no malice.

Happily he has almost recovered, and is now able to walk with the aid of crutches. In reply to questions, Captain Bower said: To suppose, as is suggested by some of the Continental papers, that the projected expedition of the Niger Company has Sokoto for its object almost amounts to absurdity. Sokoto is a large Mohammedan kingdom, whose Sultan has under his rule the Emirs of surrounding Mohammedan countries. To fight him would mean fighting all the Mohammedans in that part of Africa. It would resolve itself into a religious war. A campaign of this sort could not be entered upon with a small force like that at the disposal of the Niger Company, nor, indeed, do I believe that even the addition of any troops that could be spared from the British West African colonies would suffice for such an object. At the most the Company could not put more than 700 troops into the field, and then by seriously weakening the garrisons at their river stations. Moreover, the southern border of Sokoto is at least two months' journey from Lagos, and only about 170 miles less distance from the Niger. The last news I received regarding the attitude of the Sultan of Sokoto, showed that he and his people were friendly towards the whites, or, at the worst, were unconcerned regarding them. It is much more likely that the projected expedition is against Bida, better known as Nupe, a large kingdom lying north of Likoja, which is only separated from Ilorin by the small Yagba and Ikita countries. The attitude of these Nupe people is, and has been, of a distinctly menacing character, and they are continually sending out raiding parties. They have even got a war-camp close to Aiede, on the borders of the Lagos sphere. Before I left Agbomoso, I received messages every week from the Yagbras, asking me to protect them against the Nupes, who were raiding, taking prisoners, and burning villages in all directions; but I could, of course, only refer them to the white man on the Niger. It is this Nupe country which, amongst others, was visited last year by Captain Lugard on behalf of the Company.

The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

Apt to learn, quick to understand and to appreciate advantages, they are a people easy to assume and appropriate the best results of civilization—brave in the defence of their rights and homes, yet not aggressive, except when forced by circumstances and their teachings. We forget the whole history of this people in looking only at some particular phase or trait. Their land, the field of the slave-stealer for centuries, has been the scene of cruelty, fraud, and all the worst forms of vice. A people educated by so long a course of schooling in its vicissitudes might well be cruel and vicious. The land has been hunted, from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope, by foreign and native stealers. Tribes have been driven for self-protection, or by greed of gain, to make captures from other tribes or other parts of their own. To show the debasing power of slavery and slave-hunting, let me say that I have seen slaves brought to the coast from the central parts of Africa who were the most abject specimens of the human race I have ever known—brought by a strong, stalwart tribe, noble in bearing, and brave in war; and these, too, were the same tribe or people only a comparatively short time before. Why this great difference? A simple explanation is only required to show it all. Together and at peace, they had a generous and varied diet of animal and vegetable food, for they had extent of territory in which to hunt and gather; but divided and at war, fighting for self-protection, one party gained the supremacy. Then the other were a defeated people; circumscribed within small limits, unable to hunt, they were soon confined to vegetable diet alone, and then to a single kind, and often to a few simple roots; courage gone, they were reduced to servitude and slavery, and brought to a market.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FUTURE OF AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This argument is, of course, based upon the results of negro self-government in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH ADMINISTRATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The very air of Africa reeks with rum and gin imported by us, every hut is redolent of its fumes.

In the language of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the colonial effort, particularly in Africa, was now proclaimed to be a responsibility undertaken in the name of higher civilization, with 'the tutelage of such peoples [the colonial populations] ... entrusted to advanced nations'. 3 Behind such rhetoric still stood an attitude of cultural and racial superiority, formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and regularly given expression in descriptions of the African as childlike or 'non-adult'. The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

By 1880 cash crops included the cotton of Egypt, cloves in Zanzibar, sugar in Natal and an increasing area of groundnuts (peanuts) in Senegal, while in Algeria a European settler economy largely based on wheat and wine was being established. One aspect of trade almost certainly did have a deleterious effect on health, and that is the flow of strong alcoholic drink into the continent.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.698, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries.

Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers.

Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

Only African populations of certain regions were initially involved in inter› action with American and Caribbean blacks. Those regions involved early in our period were the ones which became the focus of American black emigration or evangelism, particularly West Africa, South Africa, and the Horn. Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Religion in Africa during the colonial era', 'section_title': 'The state of African religious life on the eve of colonial rule > Christianity in pre-colonial Africa', 'content': ""The opportunity to live in the hinterland made missionaries more and more knowledgeable about Africa and this was to become a crucial factor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century when the Scramble for Africa began.

We are not thinking only of the interests of manufacturers and merchants, which would be most seriously prejudiced by an acknowledgment of Portuguese authority on any part of that wondrous river. The future of the wide countries through which that river and its great affluents run must, and will, be largely influenced by the character of the mercantile and other operations that may be carried on there by Europeans. We felt this so strongly at the period of Mr. Henry Stanley’s return from his memorable voyage which terminated at Emboma, that our first impulse was to endeavour to organize a powerful company, under the direct protection of the British Government, which should systematically develop the trade with the interior, under such regulations as would shut out the pernicious influences which have made so much havoc along the seaboard of the West Coast generally. The late enthusiastic Mr. Bradshaw was then striving vainly to obtain public support for his projected railways from the East Coast to the great Lakes, and we endeavoured vainly to win him over to the utilization of the Congo, from the West Coast. It was not so to be; and the great credit was to be due, next to the intrepid explorer Stanley, to the enlightened King of the Belgians, under whose auspices Mr. Stanley has been since engaged in overcoming the natural obstacles presented by the long stretch of furious rapids between Stanley Pool and Emboma. Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool are now becoming ardent about the River Congo and its trade; but we cannot forget the apathetic indifference with which all attempts to utilize the discoveries of Henry Stanley were at that time received in those great seats of manufacturing industry and in that seaport so long and intimately associated with the trade of West Africa. Ardour, we say, or something resembling it, has now succeeded to the apathy; but it was only evoked by the most extraordinary project of the British Government to place the control of the great river in the hands of that of Portugal. Anything more prejudicial to British, and, in fact, to all European and United States interests, as well as to the future of that great African interior watered or drained by the Congo and its many affluents, could scarcely have entered into the heart or head of any man to conceive. The whole history of Portugal on the West Coast of Africa, as equally on the East Coast, has been of a character especially to disentitle her to the custody of any interests there but her own, which have ever been antagonistic to humanity and progress. That terrible hallucination of Earl Granville is, we hope, entirely at an end. Some mischief has resulted from it, but we trust that not any more will ensue. Great Britain not having taken, as she ought to have done, the control of the river on which she has for many years been keeping peace and protecting trade, and the vast future importance of the river being now generally acknowledged, there clearly remains no other course to be pursued but only that of neutralizing it and its trade, under international guarantees. This being settled, as it necessarily must be, the next question is, how can it be made effective, so that, while leaving trade and commerce as far as possible untrammelled, there may be a watchful and effective guardianship exercised for the future welfare of the interior African people, whom it will be for the general interest of Europe and the United States of America to bring as rapidly as possible under the ameliorating influences of Christian civilization. A watchful and effective guardianship will be indispensable to prevent the interior being deluged by rival traders with those elements of evil which have so unhappily retarded progress among the Coast population. It would be difficult to form an adequate estimate of the evils which have resulted for the Coast population from the so-called rum and gin which have been sold in prodigious quantities. We would prevent these and other agents of demoralization and debasement from circulating in the interior, if possible. And we believe it may be possible, if the civilized Governments who are to guarantee the neutrality of the river so will. We bear in mind that there has been a free importation of these, with fire-arms and gunpowder, by all the trading firms in the river below the falls, and that the population between the mouth of the river and Stanley Pool have become more or less familiarized with, and victims to, the use of those vile drinks above mentioned. Had the Upper Congo been accessible only by the banks of the river up to Stanley Pool, the security desired for the interior might have been obtained by some regulations which would, however, have met with intense opposition, and raised an awful cry among the merchants and others carrying on trade there. But another and, it may possibly prove to be, an equally advantageous and accessible route to Stanley Pool, via the Gaboon and Ogome, and from another point on the coast, having been discovered, and in part opened, by M. de Brazza, we should propose to leave the Lower Congo trade as free and unfettered as it has ever hitherto been; placing the guardianship of the vast interior at and above Stanley Pool. It seems quite clear that all the routes from the coast for the interior, whether from north or south of the mouth of the Congo, must and will converge at, or immediately above, Stanley Pool, which will, therefore, in time, become the great emporium of trade, and attract consequently a large mixed population of Europeans and natives. The climate is stated to be healthy there; and all considerations, therefore, point out that part of the country as the great connecting link of trade and civilization between the other portions of the world and the African Congo interior. This, therefore, must be the seat of civilized administration, executive, financial, and judicial. In a word, it must be the seat of civilized power—power, not of one European nation, but international. The civilized world owes an enormous debt to Africa for the injury it has caused and the barbarism it has perpetuated and intensified through that abominable foreign slave trade in which all civilized nations more or less participated; and the cost of establishing such an international power at Stanley Pool will be but a very small recompense to make for such gigantic wrong. At the same time, we do not believe that such cost need be more than a temporary advance of money.

This pamphlet throws a strong light upon a matter of which, perhaps, most people, even of those specially interested in the regeneration of Africa, have heard but little. The evidence now brought together goes to prove that in certain parts the wages of native labourers are paid, even in the case of mere boys and girls, in spirits, and that as a result, in some places, after the first hour or so, labour is unprocurable on account of the drunkenness of the people. ""The idea of drinking spirits is inseparable from the notion of European life in the ken of the natives. Owing to the relaxing climate of the rivers, there are few factories which cannot tell their tale of hard drinking and certain death as a consequence. But we are repeating an oft-told story, and those who read these pages have probably made themselves acquainted with the state of the West Coast in some degree. ... Competition is relentless; times are very bad; palm oil has fallen to a ruinous rate. But the degradation of the tribes of West Africa has reached a depth which is appalling."" Few men are more fitted to testify concerning the extent to which liquor trafficking with the native races of Africa has reached than Mr. Jas. Irvine, of Liverpool; and the following extract from a communication from him speaks volumes: ""It is very difficult to give you an account of the ramifications of the drink traffic on the West Coast of Africa—not because there is little to be said, but because it is only a repetition of the oft-told story in every part of the world. The extent of the trade is so prodigious that I think the following estimate of the quantity annually poured into the delta of the Niger relieves me from the necessity of further remark concerning this evil. ... I am sure I do not over-estimate the quantity when I put it down at 60,000 hogsheads of 50 gallons each as the annual consumption in the rivers."" We have in the native African one whose natural character is so weak that he easily becomes a victim when a dead set is made at him by those who are able to influence him. One needs go no further than the store-house of the first West African factory to know what is the native\'s weak point, and the form of the attack made upon it. His propensity to strong drink has been pandered to until things could hardly be worse with him. Mr. Joseph Thomson, the eminent African traveller, recently laid before the members of the Manchester Geographical Society his views upon this subject, and which fully support what has been already said: ""In the notorious gin trade lies a greater evil even than slavery. It is indeed a scandal and a shame. ... We talk of civilizing the negro and introducing the blessings of European trade, while at the same time we pour into this unhappy country incredible quantities of gin, rum, gunpowder, and guns. ... The trade in spirits is simply enormous. The appetite for it increases out of all proportion to the desire for better things; and, to our shame be it said, we are ever ready to supply the victims to the utmost, driving them deeper and deeper into the slough of depravity, while at home we talk sanctimoniously as if the introduction of our trade and the elevation of the negro went hand in hand.""

The frightful evils attendant upon this trade have been demonstrated by the experience of every ruler who has attempted to administer the affairs of Native States with any regard for the well-being of the Natives; they have been recognised by the chiefs in different parts of Africa, and have been discussed at international conferences, notably those of Berlin and Brussels in 1885 and in 1890. There is no doubt in the minds of experienced and practical men that the supply of intoxicating liquor to the Native races is equivalent to the demoralisation and degradation of the races concerned, and that the first condition of progress is to keep alcohol out of their reach. This is not a temperance fad or a philanthropic counsel of perfection. It is the judgment of unromantic men of business, that an essential preliminary to successful administration is to prevent the supply of spirits to the Native. A century ago Adam Smith wrote of the trade in rum which the American colonies carried on with the coast of Africa, ""whence they bring back negro slaves in return."" The conscience of the world has since been so far aroused that the return cargo of those days is no longer possible. It is but a step further to realise the fact that to sell a man to a master who has a commercial interest in taking care of him and who may be even kind, is fraught with consequences less terrible than to sell him to the domination of his own drunkenness, which in the case of the negro is surely merciless.\n\nYet at present what do we find? In the colony of Lagos about 1,700,000 gallons of spirits go every year for local consumption, and in the Niger Protectorate 1,355,000 gallons more. The duties are low enough to make the traffic profitable on the coast and to encourage Native trade with the interior. In the territory of the Niger Company a determined stand has been made against the trade. The Deputy-Governor of the Company, Sir George Goldie, urged upon the Conference of Berlin the international restrictive policy which was afterwards adopted at the Conference of Brussels, and one of the first acts of the Company after receiving their charter was to impose a heavy duty upon spirits crossing their frontier. Later on, it totally prohibited the introduction of spirits into about one-third of the inland portion of its sphere, and in 1890 the prohibition was extended to ""any place within the jurisdiction of the Company north of the 7th parallel of north latitude."" The proximity of the two colonies in which liquor is cheap renders prohibition on the coast impracticable.

He said into British West Africa, including the four colonies of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, together with the Niger Coast Protectorate and the territory of the Royal Niger Company, a total of more than five million gallons of rum and gin was imported in 1893, and the supply appeared to be increasing at the rate of about half-a-million gallons a year.

Even now the duties on imported spirits levied in British possessions were, on the whole, higher than those imposed elsewhere in West Africa, and gain—not loss—appeared to result therefrom. But the present duties, even the highest of them, were far too low, and what was asked for by the Society was that the duties should be at once raised to some extent, and that there should be a steady progressive increase from year to year, or at intervals of not more than two years, to enable traders to adapt themselves to the altered conditions, until a satisfactory standard was reached.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

""Freetown, with its hills rising behind it, forms a pretty picture from the bay where ships lie at anchor, but the town itself is fairer to behold from a distance than pleasant to inspect closely.

A reference to the Blue Book Africa No. 4 (1885) will show, what is moreover well-known at the Foreign Office, that this question had been warmly urged on the British Delegates by your Deputy Governor, Sir George Goldie, who was acting as the Company\'s representative, at the Berlin Conference, and who in so doing was only giving effect to the deep conviction he had long entertained, and which he had succeeded in impressing on his colleagues in the Council. These opinions were adopted by the British Delegates, and were pressed by them on the Conference before the earliest representation had been made by any public body in England to our Foreign Secretary. Her Majesty\'s Government were unable to carry their proposal at the Berlin Conference owing to the opposition of certain other Powers; but, largely in consequence of the strenuous efforts of the United Committee, the policy advocated by Sir George Goldie at Berlin has, within the last few weeks, been adopted by Europe at the Brussels Conference. We have lost no time in taking advantage of this International Agreement, and we have this morning made a Regulation absolutely prohibiting the importation of spirituous liquors, for sale or barter, into any place within the jurisdiction of the Company north of the seventh parallel of north latitude—that is to say, into about nineteen-twentieths of the regions over which the Company has treaty rights of jurisdiction. We trust the day is not far distant when the same policy may be enforced in the remaining twentieth of our Territories; but until the Company\'s military force is greatly strengthened, the attempt would inevitably be attended by disastrous failure. All we can do there, is to pursue our present policy of discouraging the importation of spirits within these restricted limits by levying on them the highest practicable duty.""\n\nIt is, indeed, a remarkable fact, and not altogether creditable to the Colonial Office that, while this courageous and far-seeing policy is adopted by a chartered Company of merchant rulers, the adjacent British Crown Colony of Lagos, with a population about half of that of Brighton, annually imports more than 1,000,000 gallons of European spirits, on which only a trivial duty is levied.', 'last_edit_date': '1891-02-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_02_1891#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.663, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'SIERRA LEONE, AND ITS PEOPLE.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'My voyage along the coast and visits to all the principal places have astonished me profoundly. I looked forward with pleasure to a study of the influence which a century of contact with civilization has effected in the barbarous tribes of the seaboard. The result has been unspeakably disappointing. Leaving out of consideration the towns of Sierra Leone and Lagos, where the conditions have been abnormal, the tendency has been everywhere in the line of deterioration. There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder. These they get in return for a few months\' or a year\'s labour, to go back home and for a few short days enjoy a fiendish holiday. I visited one of their villages and such a scene of squalor and misery I have rarely seen. Yet it is said, and I believe with truth, that if you retain a Kru-boy in the most comfortable of traders\' homes longer than a year, he will sicken and die, so much does he pine for his savage and unsavoury home.\n\nIn these villages, men, women, and children, with scarcely a rag upon their persons, follow you about beseeching for a little gin or tobacco. Eternally gin, tobacco, or gunpowder. These are the sole wants aroused by a century of trade and contact with Europeans! And yet how is this region represented in England? Why, as a field ""white unto harvest."" The African is described as looking to our Government for a more settled rule; as crying to the Churches, ""Come over and help us;"" to our merchants, ""We have oil, and rubber, and ivory: give us in exchange your cloth and your cutlery;"" ""Ye see us naked, and ye clothe us not;"" to the philanthropist, ""We are able and willing to work, only come and show us the way.""

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters.

C. Rayner, District Commissioner of the Gold Coast Colony, read a paper on ""The Drink Traffic in West Africa."" He said that most of those who had interested themselves in this question had stated that wholesale demoralisation and degradation of native races had followed the introduction of the liquor traffic among them. West Africa had been singled out as a bad example of what was going on. He had recently returned from a year\'s residence on part of that coast, and his official position had given him every opportunity of inquiring into this matter. The conclusion to which he had been led was somewhat opposed to that commonly received, and certainly differed from the preconceived opinion he had formed before he went out. His experience had led him to think that the evils of the liquor traffic had been exaggerated, and that there was nothing like the wholesale demoralisation of native races going on of which we were accustomed to hear. At the same time it was undoubtedly true that a vast amount of alcoholic liquor was being imported, and a very lucrative trade was being done by the European and native merchants in the coast towns. The sale of intoxicating liquors was practically unrestricted on the Gold Coast. A small duty was charged upon all imported into the colony, and formed the chief part of the colonial revenue. The cost of government was borne chiefly by the liquor traffic. Extreme temperance friends would be inclined to hold up their hands in pious horror at such an arrangement, but it was only fair to remember that it had much to recommend it even from their standpoint, as a Customs tariff discouraged the importation of such dangerous articles as spirits and gunpowder by saddling them with the payment of duties. As to the effect of the liquor traffic upon the natives, he said that even among the lowest and most degraded of African savages it was impossible to find such wretchedness and vice as ten minutes\' walk from the room in which they were assembled would take them to. He had also been unable on the Gold Coast to trace any close connexion between drink and crime, and on this point he claimed to speak with some authority. And as to the physical deterioration of native races through drink, he thought those who had seen much of the African at home would agree with him that as yet he showed no sign of this. At the same time he was far from saying that the drink traffic was doing no harm. Happily it had not yet wrought the mischief in Africa which it had at home, but the trade was increasing, and it was impossible to say what evil it might do in the future if it were allowed to go on unchecked. To prohibit the traffic would be simply to ruin the British colonies without doing any good, for in such a case the trade would be diverted to the French or German settlements in close contiguity to our own. And, as had been pointed out, it was better to retain the traffic in our own hands, so as to be able to regulate it. His own view was that at present they must work in Africa as they had had to do in England, by moral suasion. This work had already been begun, and, he was glad to say, was progressing satisfactorily.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-03-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_03_1889#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.668, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Spirit Trade with West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'It has been thought necessary to array the facts of the liquor trade as known by merchants, by their agents residing on the West Coast, and by the official classes.

It is recommended that an inquiry should be instituted by Royal Commission, or by competent authorities, of whom the Government have many at their command, into statements which have been made respecting the trade in spirits with West Africa and its effects. These statements were made at meetings held at home and abroad in the reports of which, by the Press, it was noticed that hardly one substantial fact appeared supporting them: 1. That the Native races of Africa are deteriorating through excessive consumption of spirits. 2. That drunkenness is increasing in Native villages to an alarming extent. [Suggestion—That surprise visits should be paid to the principal villages and Native markets.] 3. That the drunkenness is due to imported spirits, and not to those of Native manufacture, such as palm wine. 4. That the imported gin and rum, &c., are vile and poisonous liquids. [Suggestion—That bottles be purchased and sent home for analysis.] 5. That the importation of spirits is excessive in proportion to population. And the Committee would recommend further: That the criminal statistics and reports on crime from the colonies should be investigated with the view of seeing whether they furnish evidence of such a state of things as described. The Committee deem it most essential for the present maintenance and future development of British trade with West Africa that there should be a more complete understanding and uniformity of practice amongst all the European powers ruling on the coast as to the duties levied on merchandise, including spirits. The inner boundaries of the colonies and protectorates, not to speak of those of mere spheres of influence, are ill-defined and generally unprotected. Merchandise of a portable kind can be carried from foreign ports where lower duties are charged and exchanged in the hinterlands of British colonies, in which colonies the duties are on a higher scale, to the detriment of the colonial revenues and British traders, including carriers by sea. Before a Customs Union was effected this applied to Togoland and the Gold Coast, and it may still apply to the northern rivers and to Liberia in relation to Sierra Leone, to French Benin in relation to Lagos, and to the Cameroons and Niger Territories in relation to the Niger Coast Protectorate.

The Boma left the Cameroons River on Oct. 11, at which date six chiefs had recently been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment, and were then awaiting transportation to the German Togo territory, which adjoins the Gold Coast. Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world. They see no contradiction, and have no difficulty, in combining Christian and traditional Nguni rites in marriage and funeral ceremonies.$^{2}$ Professor Fallers has also described some Ugandan groups as \'enthusiastically and successfully\' accepting many elements of modernization - confining their influence, and adapting them to traditional culture and social structure. The point is that colonial Africans were probably not unaware of the elementary fact that accepting \'new forms [would] increase the range of alternatives\'$^{3}$ available to them.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.653, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""Though it has been correctly pointed out that it is difficult to group the different organizations into clear-cut categories, especially owing to their functional versatility, we shall here distinguish between three kinds. In the first group are those organizations which could be described as purely 'social', that is devoted to promoting conviviality and relaxation. These were made necessary by the absence from the towns of the traditional forms of amusement, relaxation and citizenship training - such as the masquerades, age-grade associations and traditional festivities. There was also the attraction of forms of modern European social life as advertised in the life of the European community in each colony. In this category were the football clubs, Scout and Girl Guide movements, debating societies and alumni associations.\nIn the second group are the ethnic unions. These were an extension of rural ethnicity to the urban areas. There were different hierarchies of them - village, clan and ethnic unions. These had two main functions. One was to help the individual who had migrated newly to the town to adjust as smoothly as possible to the conditions of urban life. Thus when a migrant first reached the town, he usually made his first contacts with members of his village or clan union who would help to find him accommodation, to introduce him to employers of labour or master craftsmen to teach him modern skills. They also taught him how to comport himself in the city. Through such associations members got help when in difficulty. They could get loans to continue their business if they sustained crippling losses. Funeral, marriage and other expenses approved by the association could also be met with loans or donations from the group as the case may be. ' ° The other function of the ethnic unions was 'to provide a channel for progressive public opinion at home', especially through maintaining an organized link between the sons at home and the sons abroad. To do this they had to take an interest in the political and social development of their homes. At first this won the associations the opposition and obstruction of suspicious colonial officials. In south-eastern Nigeria, for instance, where by the 1930s the colonial power was still toiling to entrench the idea of native authorities, the formation of these unions caused uneasiness in official circles.

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.647, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The arts in Africa during the period of colonial rule', 'section_title': 'The theatrical arts', 'content': ""only of receiving, but of practising the refined arts of the European.

As it moved eastward, however, it received ever-increasing blood transfusions. The bastardized vaudeville of the 'Nova Scotians', a self-appellation of the returnees of Sierra Leone, did enjoy a long run along the coast. However, its arrival in the more easterly countries of the Gold Coast, Dahomey, and Nigeria, brought about its transformation both in form and content. It is not an exaggeration to claim that, by the first decade of the twentieth century, a completely new form of theatre had achieved distinct form in West Africa: the 'concert party'.

The Christian churches organized their own concerts, schools were drawn into the concert rage - prize-giving days, visit of the district officer, Queen Victoria's birthday, etc. The black missionaries refused to be outdone - the Reverend Samuel Ajayi Crowther was a famous example; a black prelate prominent in the patronage and encouragement of this form of the arts, while the Reverend James Johnson turned the famous Breadfruit Church in Lagos into a springboard for theatrical performances. 1 $^{6}$ The Brazilian returnees added an exotic yet familiar flavour, their music finding a ready echo in the traditional melodies of the west coast and the Congo whose urban suppression had not occurred long enough for such melodies to be totally forgotten.

They were all designed to provide a basic European education for would-be teachers and low-echelon civil servants. Such cultural education as came into the curriculum of Ecole William Ponty was of necessity French - French plays, poetry, music, art, history, sociology. Beart, however, during his principalship embarked on a new orientation of the students' cultural instructions. From 1930 onwards the students received encouragement to return to their own societies for cultural directions. Assignments were given which resulted in the students' explora› tion of both the form and substance of indigeous art. Groups from every colonial territory represented at William Ponty were then expected to return from vacation, armed with a theatrical presentation based on their researches, the entire direction being left in the hands of the students themselves. Since the new theatrical sociology did not confine itself to the usual audiences of European officials and 'educated' Africans nor to Senegal alone, its influence spread widely through different social strata of Franco› phone Africa. Was it, however, an authentic development of the culture from which it derived?\nThe answer must be in the negative, though the experiment was not without its instructive value. It would be too much to expect that, at that period, the 'classic' model of French theatre could yield completely to the expression of traditional forms. The 'community' represented by William Ponty was an artificial one. It was distanced from the society whose cultural hoards it rifled both in qualitative thought and in cultural ends. The situation was of course not peculiar to William Ponty but was common to the other schools and institutions set up by the colonizer for the fulfilment of his own mission in Africa. Thus the theatre of William Ponty served the needs of exotic satisfaction for the community of French colonials.

Part of the consequences of the violent movements of the Shona peoples between the Cape and Central Africa is that it is now difficult to say how much of their musical instrumentation - and indeed the social functions of their music - were carried into or came from the neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Tanganyika (now Tanzania), the Congos (now Zaire and Congo), and Uganda where the practice was widespread, into Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) where the majority of the Shona gradually became concentrated at the turn of the century. (See Fig. 8.1.) What is beyond dispute, however, is that the mbira culture became a unifying bond among the scattered peoples and survived their constant and intensive fragmentation.\nMbira music was considered by the Shona a gift of their great common ancestral spirit Chaminuka who appears to have been a living person, a king in the early part of the nineteenth century. The music entered wholly into social life, penetrating it so thoroughly that it became indispensable to the various activities of healing, weddings, funerals, field labour, birth, initiations and a host of other social undertakings. The mbira instrument itself was held 'capable of projecting its sound to heaven and linking up with the world of spirits' and therefore, in effect, linked the activities and the thoughts of the living with the presence of their ancestors.\nThe performers were both settled and itinerant; they did not always wait upon invitations, although notable mbira players have been hired from distances of hundreds of miles either for their sheer artistic reputation, or because their style of playing was considered best suited to a desired end - usually the successful possession of a medium. It can be observed that a culturally cohesive community was maintained in this way, across geographical boundaries. The night-long bira ceremonies which moved early into the possession of the medium, thereafter into the purely social pleasures of dancing, singing, poetic (including comic) recitals and mimicry, have been aptly described as 'a long, communal journey through the night'.

Indeed, besides the gent who made the original motion, and he who seconded it, there were no ardent supporters of it; some openly expressed their preference to the society of niggers who were capable of holding converse with them in such language as they had been accustomed to at home, rather than to that of men who had only acquired the art of expressing themselves intelligibly in their own mother tongue since their arrival in the land of niggers, and by intercourse with those same niggers.

We go further than this, and equally maintain that not only the vanguard of the army of civilization must necessarily consist of educated Africans, but that the army itself must be chiefly composed of them. With this conviction rooted in our mind, the question of education in West Africa has for many years past greatly occupied our attention. The end in view being so great, and of so vast importance primarily to Africa, and secondarily to the whole civilized world, it is natural we should have asked ourself whether the means of education at present employed are adequate for the purpose; and if not, how and by whom those means are to be made so. We have already adverted to the unselfish efforts of the religious societies of Great Britain (and in the case of Liberia, of those of the United States of America) in diffusing among the natives the great blessing of education. The efforts of the Missionary Societies, and more especially of the Church Missionary Society, have been unremitting and gradually increasing in scope and efficiency, until they would seem at last to have culminated in the affiliation of their Fomah Bay College at Sierra Leone to the University of Durham, whereby degrees may be obtained by Africans who have never left their native land. By these efforts of Missionary Societies, the Church of England and the Wesleyan Methodist, all who can boast of any degree of education in West Africa have been rescued from heathen ignorance, and prepared more or less, for civilized usefulness. It was, perhaps, well and unavoidable, though we are far from saying or thinking that it was so, that so all-important a work, if Africa is ever to be rescued from heathen degradation, should have been hitherto left in the hands of the Missionary Societies. But that it ought any longer to be so left, we most emphatically deny. Under those noble efforts of the Missionary Societies, combined with constantly increasing facilities for commerce which steam navigation has supplied, the condition of the British settlements has undergone so great a change, that a continued dependence on missionary effort for the education of the people will, if persisted in, be a gross injustice and disgrace on the part of the British Government. This is so patent that we feel convinced it is only necessary the subject should be urged upon their attention to induce such action on their part as shall wipe away the reproach that now justly attaches to them, and relieve the Missionary Societies from a charge to which their funds, so urgently required for the propagation of Christian truth in other localities in the great heathen world, ought not to be any longer subject. Education ought to be now organized and diffused in and from the British settlements by and at the charge of the local revenues. The inadequacy of means, which as regards the Gold Coast, for instance, might have been pleaded some ten or twelve years ago, when the public revenue there did not exceed annually the sum of seven or eight thousand pounds, can no longer be urged now that the revenue has attained the comparatively magnificent amount of one hundred thousand pounds a year. A similar comparative increase has been experienced at Lagos; and if the revenues of Sierra Leone and the Gambia have not advanced in the same ratio, they are still sufficient, if properly administered, to meet the great and urgent want of public education, under the organization and auspices of the State. A State education is what we now claim for West Africa, and in especial for the Gold Coast and Lagos. A systematic and adequate commencement of it ought not to be any longer delayed. A Liberal Government in Great Britain cannot surely any longer deny to the people of West Africa that of which they have been such earnest promoters, both individually and collectively, at home. It can scarcely be necessary to remind the Earl of Kimberley that, as Crown Colonies, those settlements are altogether dependent upon an initiative from Downing-street; that themselves, the people, even if they felt the need, can do nothing; that the expenditure of the public revenue is entirely at the command of the Secretary of State for the Colonies; and that it now rests with him either to aid in or retard the Christian civilization of West Africa, which cannot progress without a more general diffusion of education than can or ought to be expected from the Missionary Societies of Great Britain. While, however, we are prepared to maintain that it is now the duty of Government to undertake the work of the education of the people, both elementary and higher, in all the West African settlements, we shall confine ourselves more especially at this time to the claims and needs of the Gold Coast and Lagos. The influence that may be diffused from these British settlements in the great work of the civilization of Africa would be immense, and justly entitles them to our especial consideration as regards public education in West Africa. It is from Lagos that the work of civilization must proceed to the moral conquest of the whole of those extensive territories that are bounded by the River Niger, and of that blood-stained kingdom of Dahomey, whose sanguinary customs continue, though of late but little spoken of, to outrage humanity, and exhibit the worst features of ignorant heathen barbarism. In considering the question of State education in Lagos, it is incumbent on the British Government to take into consideration that the public revenue of that portion of the Gold Coast Colony is derived entirely from traffic in the produce of those interior countries; that the spread of civilization increases production; and that therefore, while on the one hand it is imperatively their duty, it is not less their interest, as rulers of this Crown settlement, to devote a portion of that revenue to constitute Lagos a focus of light from Britain, to be diffused throughout the Egba and Yoruba countries, and the territories of their unquiet neighbour, Dahomey. The presence of Great Britain on the coasts of these countries of West Africa, after her own renunciation and denunciation of the infamous and horrible foreign slave-trade, was justified by her presence there being absolutely necessary for securing the final annihilation of that traffic, and remedying in some degree, by the security she gave and the repression she exercised, the fearful results that had been produced there by it, and the outrages on humanity perpetrated at the behests of sanguinary superstitions, which had been made through successive ages its active agents and accomplices. Under her ægis a new condition of things has gradually arisen; and although—such is the tenacity of evil—her presence could not even yet be dispensed with as regards the repression of slave-trading propensities, this repression ought now to be regarded as a secondary, and the spread of civilization the primary, justification of her continued rule. Those who have known this journal during the past twenty years cannot need to be reminded that we have ever laid it down as an axiom that a basis of British power on the Coast is indispensable to the success of missionary enterprise and the progress of civilization in Africa. The natives have become so debased by superstition during ages upon ages of heathen darkness, that they are incapable of believing in anything that does not come to them accompanied by evidences of power. They have such evidence at Lagos; they have it within the mainland territories of the Gold Coast Colony. That evidence will suffice to insure the gradual acceptance of civilization when once the interior populations, as well as those in the Coast towns,', 'last_edit_date': '1880-07-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1880#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa at the Meeting of the British Association', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The Niger and Central Soudan Sketches"" was the subject of a paper by Mr. Joseph Thomson, F.R.G.S. In this paper the author described his impressions of the lower part of the Niger and of the Central Soudan acquired in the course of a commercial and political mission last year to the Sultans of Sokoto and Gandu. On his way along the West Coast of Africa he noted the influence for good or evil which contact with white men has had upon the natives, and concluded that while there is much we have reason to be proud of, there is still more of which we ought to feel ashamed. He expressed the opinion that for every negro the missionaries have influenced for good by Christian teaching, a thousand had been driven into deeper degradation by other influences. He also found the settlements absurdly over-governed on a system totally unsuited to the peculiarities of barbarous races. That part of the Niger which the author traversed is divided into three sections according to their physiographical features—(1) the delta, (2) the low-lying region between the delta and the coast mountains, and (3) the irregular valley which has been cut out of the interior plateau. On reaching Lokoja, at the confluence of the Benué with the Niger and the commencement of the third section, the Central Soudan is entered. The changes which occur here, whether physiographical or ethnological, are striking in the extreme. ""Behind us are the unwashed, barbarous *sans culottes* of the coast region, with fetishism, cannibalism, and the gin bottle in congenial union; before us lies a people astir with religious activity and enthusiasm, and wonderfully far advanced in the arts and industries."" Mr. Thomson took occasion to point out the enormous influence for good—though not unmixed—which Mahomedanism exercises among the inhabitants of the Central Soudan. On reaching Rabba in the Kupé country the river journey ended, and the journey to Sokoto had to be continued by means of the ordinary African caravan. The difficulties with the porters were described and the countries traversed were sketched, the route being through Kupé and Yauri to the Gulbi-n-Gindi, which is then followed to the neighbourhood of Sokoto. In conclusion, the author described the commercial prospects of these parts. He expressed the opinion ""that in all the wide range of tropical Africa there is no more promising field for commerce than this semi-civilized region which forms the central area of the Niger basin."" He came to this conclusion not on the ground that it is more fertile or more rich in natural productions—though in those respects comparing favourably with other parts—but for other reasons. These may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) It is more densely populated than any other part of Africa, and divided into powerful and, in Africa, exceedingly well-governed empires, in which life and property are almost as sacred as in Great Britain. (2) The peoples are far advanced in civilization, and throughout Northern Africa are famed for the excellences of their various manufactures. (3) The necessary machinery and organization to work the inland trade is ready to hand, as the Houssa trader is famed for his commercial genius and enterprising spirit. (4) An efficient transport service already exists, as the horse, camel, bullock, and donkey flourish in their thousands. (5) Owing to the much sterner conditions under which the people live, labourers are to be found without stint. (6) The River Niger presents an uninterrupted waterway into the very heart of this region. (7) The country, for Africa, is eminently healthy, especially away from the immediate neighbourhood of the rivers. While thus presenting such a favourable view of the prospects of the Central Soudan, the author was careful to warn people that African trade is not to be developed with a sudden rush, but as the results of forethought and careful plodding.', 'last_edit_date': '1886-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Though Englishmen naturally think that English rule is best, other nations cannot be as thoroughly persuaded of the truth.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

The right honourable gentleman and yourself may not fully comprehend the meaning of this important point in the memorial, and be led to inquire what are the good effects which have been produced by those societies. I will explain. Between 1837 and 1841 the sitting magistrates at the Gambia were wearied with one complaint and one plea throughout the rainy seasons, when business is half closed, and no employment can be found for the lower class of workmen, such as labourers, &c. These men must live, and when they could not obtain their living honestly, they procured it by dishonesty, going about stealing from the merchants\' stores, &c., and when taken before the magistrates they pleaded not guilty, giving as their poor, groundless reason, ""that they were in want, and, having nothing to live upon, as there was no work to do in the rains, and no merchant willing to give them credit, they were obliged to rob."" The magistrates then saw the real wants of the people, and consulted a Wesleyan missionary (now in England) to see if he could manage some means of restraining those lawless characters. The rev. gentleman then called on one of his local brethren to see what could be done. They concluded to form a ""Workmen\'s Club"" for assisting each other throughout the rains. The local brother mustered the whole of his tribe and explained to them in their own language the shame and disgrace some had brought on themselves, &c. He then showed them the necessity for a Workmen\'s Club, for assisting each other in time of need. The proposal was unanimously voted; and thus the first Eboe society started in the year 1842. It consisted of both males and females, and up to this day a male member pays 1s., and a female 6d. per month. At the close of every meeting the members were warned to be honest, and informed that should they require any necessary assistance the club will be ready to meet their wants. In the course of two years the practices complained of were totally forgotten. People became honest and respectful, other tribes following their example, until all the various tribes in the Gambia formed themselves into similar societies with similar objects. It succeeded so well that the magistrates and merchants returned their thanks to the rev. gentleman for his kind suggestion to the people. The people are also, to this day, grateful to him and to his local brother, their own countryman, whose son is now in London, sent by his countrymen to study for their further welfare.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-12-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1865#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WHEAT CULTIVATION IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Sabbaths here are vilely profaned, and very often are weekdays, when drum-beating, singing and dancing are loudly carried on, even in front of the House of God, during Divine service.

The aged and the young, parents with their children, males and females, are to be seen in crowds in different quarters of the town, night and day, abandoning themselves to revelry and licentiousness which it is truly painful to behold.

All this is but a faint description of Accra life and pleasure.\n\nIn looking on at what passes here daily, the idea of the kingdom of Satan naturally presents itself to the mind; and truly Satan is hard at work in this quarter.\n\nThe ignorance and want of proper training of the female portion in this our community is another calamity; and contributes to the torrent of evil which now flows in this place.

Some time ago trade in the Cameroons was so unsatisfactory that the traders, both English and German, formed a “conference,” and agreed to pay only certain prices to the Natives for produce. This agreement was maintained for some time, but appears to have been broken at last by one of the German houses. After this the Natives formed a “conference” against the traders, which one of the Natives broke in the same way by trading with an English house on the old terms. This Native and his people were seized by the other members of the “conference” and very badly treated, besides having everything in their canoes taken from them. Dr. Seitz, the Acting Governor, was administering the colony, and promptly had the offenders arrested. They included all the leading Natives of the place, and they were tried and found guilty of the offence charged against them. Three of them, including a king, were each fined a money payment, and six other chiefs were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. The Natives of the place were in a state of great excitement. Governor Puttkamer arrived in the Cameroons just as the Boma left, and it was believed by the Natives that he would cancel the sentences on the chiefs.

The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin. They might be weaned from slave-dealing, man-hunting, the burning of witches, and the offering of human sacrifices, and he did not know of any African prince who could be accused of anything like the beheadings and the quarterings that took place in the reigns of Henry VIII., Mary, and Elizabeth, nor did he find that any native African priesthood had been guilty of one-tenth of the horrible cruelty which had been perpetrated in Europe under the name of religion.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

Colonialism superimposed on the pre-existing class structure of the continent at least an extra layer of leaders and pacesetters. In East Africa where it encouraged Asian immigration, colonialism in fact superimposed two classes. In each colony Europeans had the monopoly of political, economic and educational power, except in East Africa where a fraction of the economic power fell into the hands of Asians. In this situation the Africans became the underprivileged and looked up to the Europeans, and at times to the Asians, for leadership and example.\nThis structure of social relationship was shored up with a bogus racial theory which sought to arrange the different branches of the human family in a hierarchical order of civilization with the Africans (the Negroes) occupying the bottom of the ladder while the Europeans (whites) occupied the top. In Southern Africa, in particular, where white settlers found themselves locked in conflict with numerically superior Bantu peoples, the racial theory was especially stringent, with the authority of the Holy Bible being wrongly used to reinforce the presumed social implications of pseudo-Darwinism.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Those historians who did pay some attention to this subject mentioned it almost accidentally or casually. In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies. It is to correct this wrong interpretation of the colonial school and to redress the balance and highlight the African perspective that we have devoted as many as seven chapters to this theme of African initiatives and reactions."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.714, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""The difficulty was that subsistence farmers had few needs and often felt that regular employment savoured of slavery$^{5 6}$ and that these tasks were women's work.$^{57}$ Europeans, frustrated by seeing large profits slipping away from them, had little sympathy with such attitudes: 'fear had to take the place of ambition or covetousness as the motive sentiment inducing them to labour'.$^{58}$ The solutions were primitive and often brutal. For government purposes forced labour was used, with the chiefs designat› ing those who were to work. Individual and hut taxes were imposed, with, in some areas and more frequently in the earlier years of the system, the possibility of commuting payment to labour. The Mossi of Upper Volta, following the introduction of taxation after the French conquest in 1896, at first attempted to increase production and trading, but soon the young men began to seek paid seasonal employment in the Gold Coast, only to find the taxes trebled between 1906 and 191o.$^{59}$ The system had a long history; it was being used as part of a new French approach to colonization in the 1920s when the Mossi were employed on the Ivory Coast railways and other projects designed to improve the infrastructure of French West Africa, although porterage petered out in the 1930s as lorries became more plentiful.$^{60}$ In addition Africans were recruited and conscripted into armies and police forces. In some areas labour was recruited from overseas, such as the importation of Indians to build the Mombasa-Uganda railway at the beginning of the present century and to cultivate sugar in Natal from as early as i860.

This is usually provided through a diffusion of the culture of the colonizer through education. Attainments within the educational system established for this purpose provide the yardsticks for raising a new group of elites among the colonized society. However, the diffusion of the imported culture of the colonizer almost invariably involves not only harmonious culture contacts, but also culture conflicts, which could find expression in violent reactions from the subject people. Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa.

First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape.

If they have 200 or 300 muskets and ammunition in proportion, they think success is certain. No traders having ever before entered Manyuema, the value of ivory was quite unknown. Indeed, the tusks were left in the forests with the other bones where the animals had been slain—many were rotten, others were gnawed by a rodent animal to sharpen his teeth, as London rats do on leaden pipes. If civilly treated, the people went into the forest to spots where they knew elephants had been killed either by traps or spears, and brought the tusks for a few copper bracelets. I have seen parties return with so much ivory, they carried it by three relays of hundreds of slaves. But even this did not satisfy human greed. The Manyuema were found to be terrified by the report of guns; some, I know, believed them to be supernatural, for when the effect of a musket-ball was shown on a goat, they looked up to the clouds, and offered to bring ivory to buy the charm by which lightning was drawn down. When a village was assaulted, the men fled in terror, and women and children were captured. Many of the Manyuema women, especially far down the Lualaba, are very pretty, light-colored, and lovely. It was common to hear the Zanzibar slaves—whose faces resemble the features of London door-knockers, which some atrocious iron-founder thought were like those of lions—say to each other, \'Oh, if we had Manyuema wives, what pretty children we should get!\' Manyuema men and women were all vastly superior to the slaves, who evidently felt the inferiority they had acquired by wallowing in the mire of bondage. Many of the men were tall, strapping fellows, with but little of what we think distinctive of the negro about them. If one relied on the teachings of phrenology, the Manyuema men would take a high place in the human family. They felt their superiority, and often said truly, \'Were it not for fire-arms, not one of the strangers would ever leave our country.\' If a comparison were instituted, the Manyuema, taken at random, placed opposite, say, the members of the Anthropological Society of London, clad, like them, in kilts of grass cloth, I should like to take my place alongside the Manyuema, on the principle of preferring the company of my betters; the philosophers would look wofully scraggy. But though the \'inferior race,\' as we compassionately call them, have finely-formed heads and often handsome features, they are undoubtedly cannibals.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters. I am against the idea that nothing but cruel whipping is considered punishment by the negroes, who would be quite as easily kept in order by solitary confinement, which they hate, or by hard labour, which last means of correction is recommendable from the economical point of view.""', 'last_edit_date': '1886-12-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1886#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MR.

The great future wealth of the interior plateaux will certainly lie in their mineral deposits, the riches of the West Coast region lie in its numerous and valuable vegetable products, of which the most striking are palm oil, and ground nuts, benniseed, shea butter, rubber, gums, spices, cotton, dyes, and valuable timbers, among which ebony occupies a prominent place. With regard to animal products, I might mention ivory and monkey skins. Whereas some of the great races of the interior speak languages which connect them with the Hamitic and Semitic families. The native inhabitants of the West Coast are all that there is of most typically Negro in character; yet I do not mean they are races of particularly low development; on the contrary, the typical Negro is a fine specimen of man, and is by no means as low in his mental state as the races of Polynesia and America. I may cite the Kru tribes of that portion of West Africa which is known as Liberia, a country inhabited by an industrious, energetic, hardworking, stalwart population of free men. An element of heterogeneous ex-slave settlers among the tribes of the coast may be found in some parts of the Colonies of Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos. These people represent the Nemesis which invariably follows national crimes. We and our American children indulged to a greater extent than any other European nation in the African slave trade, and, as our wrong-doing was violent and exaggerated, so to a certain extent was the abrupt reparation which followed. Although I would not minimise the work done by our blockade on the West Coast, the abolition of the slave trade was more effectually brought about by the abolition of slavery in the United States of America. One result of our suppression of the slave trade in West Africa has not been altogether advantageous. I refer to the Slave Colonies established at Sierra Leone, and at Fernando Po and other points on the coast. It may be taken that the slaves exported from any district are the least worthy people in it, and the result is that a large proportion of this population is descended from the sweepings of West Africa, and has not yet passed through sufficient generations to eliminate the ancestral badness of its progenitors. So, although here and there a negro has shown what the race can attain to under favourable circumstances, still the bulk of the ""S\'a Leone"" people who are scattered up and down the coast are of an undesirable character, and the cause of indiscriminating blame on the part of superficial observers which is most unjustly laid on the shoulders of the entire population of West Africa; whereas many of these races are superior in intelligence, enterprise, and integrity to any of our negro fellow-subjects in South Africa or the West Indies. What admirable recruits to civilised society can be obtained from many of these people may be instanced by such men as Bishop Crowther, Archdeacons Johnson and Crowther, Samuel Lewis, and other divines and lawyers and officials in West Africa, who are on a par with well-educated white men, and in some cases superior in intelligence and acquirements to the whites with whom they come in contact. It is absurd, however, to regard the Negro race, as a whole, on the same average level as the European—they are far below us. Take them in their native wilds, and they are what we were before Julius Caesar landed in this country; indeed, in many cases they are not 2,000 years behind us, but 10,000. They are in the condition of some of the earliest inhabitants of Britain, and Gaul, and Spain, whose history we can dimly spell out from their implements and scattered remains, who were undoubtedly cannibals and probably naked, and leading a brutish life. Yet we can in a few years drag them from the condition that prevailed 2,000 years before Christ into the year of grace 1889. We can take a cannibal from the Upper Cross River, and transport him to the centres of civilisation in England or America, where everything represents the utmost result of our present development; but what will be usually the result both with the individual and the race? The savage mind will be unable to grasp and assimilate one-third of the wonders presented to his consideration, and will probably even suffer from the shock. We cannot expect the negroes of West Africa to become all at once intelligent, self-governing people. For many years the white races must be their guardians and educators, and we must educate the negro by force if necessary, leaving him to understand us afterwards, when we have raised him to a condition to do so. This, then, is our mission in West Africa: to instruct the natives that idleness is the eighth deadly sin; next, to so instruct the native as to the existence of the resources of this country; and, lastly, to educate him in the principles of civilised society, and so assimilate his views with our own that he and we may be bound together with the ties of commerce and Empire.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-02-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_02_1889#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Though Englishmen naturally think that English rule is best, other nations cannot be as thoroughly persuaded of the truth.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE AFRICAN PROBLEM', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the fifteenth century the Congo country was the scene of extensive operations. Just a little before the discovery of America thousands of the natives of the Congo were baptised by Catholic missionaries, and the Portuguese devoted themselves to the work of African evangelisation and exploration. They knew then as much of interior Africa as is known now after the great exploits of Livingstone and Stanley. There is a map in the Vatican, 300 years old, which gives the general physical relief and the river and lake systems of Africa with more or less accuracy; but the Arab geographers of a century before had described the mountain system, the great lakes, and the course of the Nile. Just about the time that Portugal was establishing a great empire on that continent, America was discovered, and it became the seat of Portuguese Power. Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not.

It is nearly as old as recorded  \nhistory. It has interested thinking men in Europe and Asia in  \nall ages. The imagination of the ancients peopled the interior  \nof that country with a race of beings shut out from and needing  \nno intercourse with the rest of mankind—lifted by their purity  \nand simplicity of character above the necessity of intercourse  \nwith other mortals. The Greeks especially had very high con-  \nceptions of the sanctity and spirituality of the interior Africans.  \nIndeed, the religion of some portion of Greece is supposed to  \nhave been introduced from Africa. But leaving the region of  \nmythology, we know that the three highest religions known to  \nmankind—if they had not their origin in Africa—were domiciled  \nthere in the days of their feeble beginnings, Judaism, Christianity,  \nand Mohammedanism.  \nA sacred mystery hung over that continent, and many were  \nthe aspirations of philosophers and poets for some definite  \nknowledge of what was beyond the narrow fringe they saw.\n\nThe mystery still remains. The problem continues unsolved. The conquering races of the world stand perplexed before the difficulties which beset their enterprise of reducing that continent to subjection. Europe has extended her conquests to Australia, New Zealand, and the Archipelagos of the Pacific. But, for hundreds of years, their ships have passed by those tempting regions, where ""Afric\'s sunny fountains roll down their golden sands,"" and have been able to acquire no extensive foothold in that country. The points actually occupied by white men in the equatorial regions of that continent may be represented on the map only by microscopic dots. The bulk of Central Africa is being rapidly subjected to Mohammedanism. That system is, knitting together the conquerors and the conquered into a harmonious whole; and unless Europe gets a thorough understanding of the situation, the gates of missionary enterprise will be closed.

What the newly chartered East Africa Company are proposing to accomplish on the East Coast, the Royal Niger Company are doing on the West, and apparently with more success than the colonial Governments which draw their life from Downing-street. Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed. The whole case of the German Colonial Society in Berlin thus falls to the ground."", 'last_edit_date': '1888-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1888#article-0', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sambo being the original color of man, the African becomes darker by a deposit of coloured matter in the cells or corpuscles in the true skin, or derma, which is produced by exposure to the heat of the sun, extreme degradation in their social habits, and the low state of their diet and regimen, as well as by the life consequent upon the constant internal warfare which is carried on amongst them. All these go to account for their conformation.\n\nIn every part of Africa we occasionally meet with a perfectly white child, the offspring of perfectly black parents; these are known by the name of albino. Here is a freak of nature by which they are superlatively white, with the dermal cells perfectly destitute of those pigment matters found even amongst Europeans. If a great many of these albinoes were formed into a town, and propagation encouraged, a new race of people would be formed, which, but for the climate and domestic habits, would be as white as a Greenlander.\n\nWe suppose that of the early inhabitants of this globe one family, passing through the Isthmus of Suez, entered into Africa, another branch taking quite an opposite direction, and proceeding to the temperate zone, gave origin to a different and distinct race of men, who adapted themselves to the climates they inhabited, changing their tropical habits for others suitable to the climatorial influence of the temperate and polar zones; and thus, after the lapse of ages, forming the great Caucasian race. In like manner the Mongolian race has been also formed.\n\nThe difference in shape and peculiarity of configuration in the different races may be accounted for by the different domestic habits of each class of men, the manner in which their offspring are brought up, the degree of admixture between the different tribes and races, the difference in habitation, the degree of intellectual culture, the influence of the rites and ceremonies of the religious tenets which they hold, and last, but not the least, the different climatic influences which operate on each class.\n\nFrom the foregoing the reflective mind will at once perceive that the race which descended to Africa were subject to several vicissitudes, which had a most depressing effect on them, and which deprived them of that brilliancy which is shown by the other races, but who, after a change of their religion and the cultivation of their minds, endeavour to claim their position in the world's history.

The textbook notes that the alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not deter the establishment of European plantations in other tropical regions, nor did it discourage serious applicants from West Africa. By the early twentieth century, advancements in controlling malaria and other tropical diseases began to diminish West Africa's reputation as the ""White Man's Grave."" Sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved treatment methods for tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters significantly reduced death rates among European officials in the Gold Coast. However, the text also points out that these European methods were not widely applied to the African population due to economic constraints. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight that many Europeans maintained good health in West Africa by adopting proper lifestyle and sanitary measures. Long-term residents like Mr. Clarke argue that the climate can be as healthful as other tropical regions if individuals avoid errors in personal economy, such as excessive alcohol consumption and poor hygiene. The articles emphasize that many deaths attributed to the climate are actually due to intemperance and neglect of health precautions, with testimonies from individuals like Dr. Hewan and Assistant-Surgeon J. Lambert underscoring the importance of temperance, proper diet, and cleanliness. While acknowledging the climate's challenges, such as its enervating nature and the need for careful acclimatization, both sources collectively challenge the notion that the climate alone is responsible for health issues, highlighting the significant role of lifestyle choices in maintaining good health for Europeans in West Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim that the perception of West Africa as inherently unhealthy for Europeans is exaggerated.

For instance, Mr. Clarke and other long-term residents argue that the climate can be as healthful as other tropical regions if individuals avoid errors in personal economy, such as excessive alcohol consumption and lack of hygiene. The articles also mention that many deaths attributed to the climate are actually due to intemperance and neglect of health precautions. Furthermore, testimonies from individuals like Dr. Hewan and Assistant-Surgeon J. Lambert emphasize the importance of temperance, proper diet, and cleanliness in maintaining health. Additionally, the articles note that improvements in sanitation and lifestyle have led to better health outcomes over time. However, the articles also acknowledge that the climate is not without its challenges, as it can be enervating and requires careful acclimatization.

Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.533, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': ""In tropical Africa governmental medicine was long a military concern although small civilian hospitals began to appear in the 1890s.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

Some of this reduction may have merely been a compensation for an upturn in certain diseases caused by the European presence. Nearly all authorities before the First World War believed that the sleeping sickness epidemics found across tropical Africa at that time had largely been caused by European activities and often assumed that the new communications and disturbance of the bush had spread tsetse flies or brought them close to the villages. 85 Similarly the so-called syphilis epidemic in Uganda in the early years of the century was said to be a new phenomenon and was taken so seriously that the campaign against it resulted in the foundation of the Uganda Medical Service. In Cameroon it was said to be unknown in 1895 and widespread in 1905. The truth about African syphilis is probably more complex than this: the microbe causing it is so similar to yaws that it is difficult to imagine some form of syphilis not having a long history in the continent;$^{86}$ while there is clear evidence that virulent forms of syphilis spread from Southern Africa's mining areas, it appears that milder endemic syphilis may have long been widespread and may have been communicated by a form of vaccination in Uganda. 87 With gathering momentum from the early years of the century, the campaigns"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.532, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: demographic aspects', 'section_title': 'The impact of colonialism', 'content': 'until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The British attacked sleeping sickness by keeping the tsetse fly away from people: preventing game from using waterholes in inhabited areas, clearing bush, and, more spectacularly, moving populations, as occurred from the foreshores of Lake Victoria. The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—'}, {'id': 284, 'article_title': 'REVIEW.', 'full_section_title': 'REVIEW.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1863#article-21', 'issue_date': '23_12_1863', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

On shore, from the little I have seen of it, Englishmen act very much as if they were at home, and indeed sometimes much more loosely; they smoke and imbibe alcoholic stimulants too much, and indulge especially in other forms of dissipation, which are all debilitating causes, preparing the way for the inroads of malaria. They do not look on themselves as belonging to another clime, and requiring special care and great attention to all those hygienic rules which apply with greater or less force wherever our race wanders, be it in the healthiest places possible, so far as external agencies are concerned, but which apply with especial force where, as here, many of the surrounding agencies are inimical to a healthy action of the animal functions. With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""'}, {'id': 2539, 'article_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF BATHURST, &c.', 'full_section_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF BATHURST, &c.', 'last_edit_date': '07-11-1873', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/29_08_1873#article-5', 'issue_date': '29_08_1873', 'content': 'Sir,—We regret that there have been false representations of the climate of Western Africa, especially the settlement on the Gambia. It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally.

The West Coast of Africa is not more unwholesome than was that of Western India when I was first stationed there; Bombay, as well as Sierra Leone, was once called the ""White Man\'s Grave.""\n\nYou will object that Captain Cameron and I both suffered from ague and fever during our short stay on the Gold Coast. ""I thought you were fever-proof,"" has been said to me more than once; but a man is never fever-proof in Africa, and rarely cold-proof in England, at least as long as he breathes the upper air. And we gave the climate no chance. New arrivals are advised by all old hands to avoid, for the first three months, over-exertion of mind or body. This, in our case, was equivalent to prescribing a generous diet of beefsteaks and port to a pauper patient. We had to do in twenty-four hours the work of forty-eight; we walked instead of hammocking, the better to collect specimens; and my companion, after a heavy day\'s work, often sat for hours in the dewy night to make his observations. Nor did we stay long enough to become acclimatised. Under other circumstances, we should have passed, at the end of a month or so, through a mild seasoning of ague and fever; and, after the third month, we should have been fit for any amount of exertion. I repeat, that in our case the climate had no fair play.\n\nBut look at things as they are. Of the four English managers of mines, three have retained vigorous health after years of residence on the coast. Only one suffers from rheumatic gout—a complaint certainly not confined to Western Africa. As Mr. Walker told you a few days ago, we all know Englishmen who have lived a score of years, and many more, at Bathurst (Gambia) and at Freetown (Sierra Leone), and who have returned home hale and hearty. I see sundry in this room, as good men as if they had lived in England all their lives.\n\nAnd now, permit me briefly to recapitulate. The good news we bring home is the prodigious wealth of the land; I know nothing to equal it in California or in the Brazils. Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore. Gold spangles glitter after showers in the streets of Axium. Gold is yielded by the lumps of yellow swish that rivet the wattle walls of hut and hovel. Our washings range from half an ounce to four ounces per ton.

He had spoken of from one to four ounces as being realized, but he had seen as much as twenty ounces on some occasions. This was a country which extended over 100 miles, and the sands of every river contained gold. On his visit, he made the best use of his time, and landed wherever the steamer touched, and for a thousand miles along the coast there were evidences of gold. The geological formation was eminently typical of gold, particularly the alluvial strata, and these alluvial deposits were so gigantic, that the puny efforts of the natives in the past had made no appreciable impression upon them. They only went to a very shallow depth, and rarely, if ever, tunnelled, though he had seen some open trenches. They dug down a little way, and then enlarged the hole until it fell in, and then the fetish man stepped in and made them leave the neighbourhood. In one place he came across some old mines, perhaps twenty years old, where the natives had gone down fifty or sixty feet, when evidently a large mass of earth had fallen in, and the working had been abandoned, but the richness at that depth was very striking. In one place he came upon 1,000 or 2,000 natives busily engaged on a small area of a few acres, working in gangs, day and night, washing for gold. With regard to the labour question, no doubt the Kroomen were a splendid set of men, but when operations became much enlarged, he feared this source of labour would become very limited. He had seen gold mining in Venezuela carried on very successfully with Indian coolies, but, in his opinion, it would be better to have Chinese, as they possessed more strength, and were better able to shift for themselves. In Africa, however, there need be no lack of food. There was abundance of vegetable produce. A great many people threw cold water on this enterprise on account of the climate, but when greater provision was made for comfort, sickness would decrease. If any one had travelled in Britain 2,000 years ago, when it was covered with forests, and had been taken ill, he would probably have sickened and died. The West Coast of India was, at one time, as unhealthy as the West Coast of Africa, but Bombay was now one of the finest cities in the world. Demerara, again, was one of the healthiest cities, barring yellow fever. In all these tropical countries fever was the great evil; but he would rather live in Africa, with its chances of fever, than in England, with its east winds. If the companies would treat their workmen properly, they might live there very well. He had had some experience in India, and it was known that the South Wynaad district was considered very unhealthy; but he had insisted on the company with which he was connected paying every attention to the health of the miners, and having proper dwellings; and, he believed, they had not lost a single man. If they had good dwellings and food, there was not much danger. Nine-tenths of those who perished did so through over-indulgence in stimulants.""}, {'id': 4461, 'article_title': 'Gold on the Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'Gold on the Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '07-01-1882', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_07_1882#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_07_1882', 'content': 'Dr. Hewan, being called upon by the Chairman to give his opinion on the climate of Africa, said he must begin by condemning what Mr. Walker had said about the two bottles of whiskey a week.

Indulgence generally led to over indulgence, and, in his experience, a great deal of the evil effects of the climate, so called, was really due to the manner of life in the climate. Some people over-ate themselves, and got bilious attacks, and when they ate they generally wanted something to wash it down with. He did not see why men should not enjoy as good health there as in many other tropical climates. No doubt it was moist and enervating, but you never heard of sunstroke there. If a man would avoid damp, drinking, and exposure at night, especially moonlight nights, he would do very well. The main thing was to avoid spirituous liquors; they were of use sometimes, no doubt; but they should not be taken habitually.\n\nMr. Christian Mast wished to have some idea how far what was called the Ashanti scare was in reality a source of danger.

It was not necessary for him to say anything about Captain Burton\'s paper, for they had worked hand in hand the whole time. They were both of opinion that immigration of labour was necessary for the whole West Coast, and that it would be provided best from China. At Lagos, a Frenchman told him he should be glad of 600 coolies for his commercial operations. He quite endorsed Mr. Cornish\'s remarks; he did a little dredging on the Ancobra, and the results looked very promising, though they had not been tested. He hoped the ""flats"" would be lifted by machinery, and worked down by sluices and ""long toms."" Ventilation he had seen managed very successfully by means of fans worked by hand labour, but immediately two galleries were put in communication with each other, so that there was an up and down current established, these difficulties would cease. Of course, in driving a heading, air would always be wanted to drive out the smoke after blasting. Mr. Pegler was an experienced mining engineer, and he endorsed his remarks, but he might add that in two places he had actually seen tunnels which had been driven by the natives. One of these was on the Ancobra, some distance from its junction with the Abunsa, where there was a tunnel driven in the bank (which communicated with a shaft) about 50 or 60 feet long, and some of the stuff in it was apparently very good. Mr. Liggins\'s experience was, no doubt, very valuable, but he believed more in what was told them by Captain Burton, Dr. Hewan, and other gentlemen; and there was no doubt that as the coast became better known, Europeans would live longer and more comfortably there. It was the same with other places. In 1857, Zanzibar was supposed to be so unhealthy that no one was allowed to sleep on shore; but when he was ill there with fever, Sir John Kirk sent him on shore that he might recover. Science was always progressing, and as people went more to new climates, they would adopt better means for ensuring their health. They might lose some men, but what struggle was there in which some lives were not lost for the benefit of humanity? The Ashanti scare simply showed the hollowness of the present Ashanti empire. He did not calculate labour at the English rate, but rather higher; he knew it cost 120l. to build at Bombay, though labour was cheap, what you could build for 40l. in an English dockyard.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same.

In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.'}, {'id': 6882, 'article_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'full_section_title': 'The Gold Coast Colony', 'last_edit_date': '11-23-1897', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_12_1897#article-9', 'issue_date': '01_12_1897', 'content': 'Under the above title an interesting paper was read at the Royal Colonial Institute, on Nov. 23, by T. H. Hatton Richards, Esq. (late Assistant Colonial Secretary of that Colony).\n\nMr. Richards gave a short history of the Colony since it was discovered about the fourteenth century, and dealt with the reasons which led up to the Coomassie expedition of January 1896, and which subsequently brought King Prempeh to the coast. The lecturer pointed out that Prempeh, who had assumed the title of King Kwaku Dua the Third, never really succeeded to the ""Golden Stool"" of Ashanti. By certain of his supporters he was recognised, but by the more important tribes, whose recognition was essential before he could be placed on the ""Golden Stool,"" he was not regarded in the same light. Still, with the power he had usurped, he was the man to reckon with. It was due to the strength of this expedition that Prempeh saw the futility of making anything like a stand in opposition.\n\nReferring to Accra, the capital, Mr. Richards described it as flat and uninteresting, and remarked on the absence of anything visible to make the place unhealthy. There were no mangrove swamps, the houses appeared to be fairly comfortable, while there was always a fresh breeze straight from the South Atlantic. But that the climate was bad there could be no doubt. The very severe time in Accra, towards the end of 1895 and commencement of 1896, might to some extent be ascribed to the clearing of the ""burnt area"" (the result of serious fires in 1894), and the removal of the accumulated filth of generations. Certainly, however, Accra had never been so bad before, and has not since. He wished in no way to make out the climate worse than it was; but he considered that it should be correctly stated so that those who were going there should not underrate the necessity which existed for the greatest care and caution. In the Colony there was a large and efficient medical staff, and a small nursing staff had been added, which would be a great boon to the place. Everything had been done by the Government to minimise the risks to life out there.\n\nThat the Colony was growing in importance there could be no doubt, and particularly since the opening of the country about Coomassie, and larger fields for enterprise were thereby available. The principal exports were rubber, palm kernels, gold, timber, and palm oil. Of those products the following quantities were exported in 1895: Rubber, 4,022,385 lb., value £322,070; palm kernels and other nuts, 15,791 tons, value £95,261; gold, 25,415 oz., value £91,497; timber, 3,587,837 ft., value £28,245; palm oil, 4,338,627 gals., value £213,415. Petroleum had been discovered, and promised well; but it was a lubricating and not an illuminating oil. At present he believed there was only a lull in this enterprise.

People who despise preaching will sometimes listen to the mighty voice of statistics:—\n\n""We have had most remarkable weather during the latter half of July; clear, cool sunshine, with scarcely a drop of rain. We believe that such a change is favourable to health, though we learn that there has been much sickness in Freetown, there having been nine deaths of white people during the month of July. This is a large number considering the small white population. We believe it to be very healthy in the Sherbro, and think that for the last five years the average health of the Sherbro has been better than that of Freetown. Why Sherbro should be more healthy than Sierra Leone is not easy to determine. We live in the midst of mangroves, surrounded by low, marshy land. Freetown is comparatively elevated and well drained. It ought to be healthier than this place, and yet we believe that the per-centage of deaths among Europeans is greater there than here. Perhaps it will be found that drinking, late hours, and inordinate excitements, kill more people in Freetown than the climate, and that the comparative exemption of the Sherbro is owing to the simple habits of the people, they being more separated, and having fewer opportunities for such intemperate indulgences.\n\n""If we are right in this (and we are not alone in our conviction), then it follows that temperance as a sanitary measure ought especially to be insisted on by those having official influence and authority in Sierra Leone, not in a legislative capacity, but by example and by public teaching.', 'last_edit_date': '1865-09-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_09_1865#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Lamentable Deaths of European Officials on the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Dear Sir,—I read the paragraph in your paper of this month under the above title, and can add my testimony to the value of “Lamplough’s Pyretic Saline,” if not as a sure preventive, certainly as a deterrent and palliative in African fevers.\n\nIn your remarks, however, I find no mention made of the probable causes of such mortality, which I think is necessary when speaking of the effects of a climate like West Africa, the bad reputation of which is so very much exaggerated. Nor do you make any distinction between the colonies, classing Sierra Leone with Lagos, Gambia, and Cape Coast, which I am sure the facts would not warrant.\n\nTo revert, however, to the causes of mortality on the West Coast of Africa, I am of opinion that there are many influential causes conducing to the same which might be prevented, and I take the liberty of intruding on your valuable space to enumerate one or two of them.\n\n1. The large consumption of spirituous liquors (brandy, gin, &c.) by the Europeans, Englishmen in particular, beginning from the moment they are out of bed till the last thing at night, when they have frequently to be put to bed by their friends or servants, is not calculated to improve even a strong constitution in the best of climates, much less one already broken by excesses. That a disproportionately large number of Europeans on the West Coast of Africa are very much addicted to the excessive use of strong liquors cannot be wondered at if you take into consideration the class of men who venture on that Coast, notwithstanding its bad reputation, and for a pittance which a junior clerk here would reject with contempt.\n\nCompare with Sierra Leone, where I resided for eleven years without interruption, South America, Brazil in particular, where an epidemic of yellow fever is of yearly occurrence. The salaries of clerks in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, and other ports are not less than 200l. to 250l. a-year, with a yearly increase of 50l. to 100l., besides board and lodging, or a stipulated sum for either or both. The consequence is, that a better class of Europeans go there, and by the means at their disposal are able to provide themselves with conveniences and even luxuries, which are requisite to a comfortable residence in the tropics. In Brazil, no doubt, some Europeans drink themselves to death, but they are few; the majority, being of a better class, prefer to live well and to enjoy themselves rationally, without making beasts of themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1876-03-29', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1876#article-2', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The (Colony of the)', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

The whole western side of that vast continent (Africa) is one hotbed of disease.""\n\nIt is well known that in all diseases the great restorative agent is pure air, and this is obtained on lofty ranges, along the seacoast, or elsewhere, inaccessible to the influence of malaria. This fact has been established in India beyond all doubt, and extensively acted upon, irrespective of expense, it being known that life is sure to be saved by it. In the West Indies the same sanitary measure has been taken, in the formation of a camp, at a\n\nNew Castle, the attitude of which defies the approach of the most pestilential lithoral poison.\n\nBut it appears that, until lately, there has been scarcely any knowledge amongst Englishmen that the West Coast of Africa is garrisoned by British soldiers, whose lives are as precious as any other soldiers, and who go heartily to fight for their sovereign against, not only barbarous tribes, but also against the pestiferous, ghastly miasma that poisons the atmosphere of many parts of this Coast. This was abundantly proved in the late disastrous expedition against the King of Ashantee, where men and officers died without number, and without even seeing an enemy. There has been a great neglect respecting the requirements of the West Coast of Africa, and even a simple account of the Coast, in these enlightened days, is received with the same wonder and surprise as the adventures of Mungo Park and Robinson Crusoe. So little, indeed, is known of it, that in print, in public speeches, and in private conversation, it is termed the most unhealthy region in the world; yet still if one takes the percentage of deaths amongst the different stations of the British Army, irrespective of the great sanitary measures used by the Government, it will be found that many of them were by far more unhealthy than the West Coast of Africa. The African Times has always endeavoured to point this out; and as a proof of it, I may state that some time ago, so great and so frequent was the amount of havoc committed on the soldiers quartered in one of the West Indian Islands by disease, that all but one officer were laid hors de combat, so that the troops were entirely withdrawn, and a notice was sent to the colonial authorities that, should they intend to keep the island, they were to increase their police force.', 'last_edit_date': '1864-12-20', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1865#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.606, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The following is taken from an article from the pen of Dr. J. A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2. Avoid getting chilled by standing or sitting for any length of time when the body is unduly heated, or by neglecting to change underclothing as soon as possible after profuse sweating.', 'last_edit_date': '1887-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1887#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.613, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sanitariums for West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""It is evident, therefore, that the best military sanitarium is that which is situated, more or less, in the centre of the military stations on the Coast.

Officers there are consequently more seldom affected by the malaria in the low land. Still further in the interior, Leicester Mountain stands in great prominence, above 2,000 feet above the sea's level, possessing a fine table land on its summit, and an agreeable and pleasant view all round. Beyond this is the Sugar Loaf, a mountain from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height, and second to none in Western Africa, except that at Cameroons and Fernando Po.

As regards suppers, I have rarely seen them in any part of Africa I have visited, both East and West Coasts; I have not seen twelve supper parties in as many years, unless on board of some outward-bound mail steamer, among the newcomers and the officers of the steamer; men who go to bed at 10 to 11 P.M., after a comfortable dinner, could not take supper.\n\nAs to the use of spirits, that varies greatly.

547,Misrepresentations and exaggerations of West Africa's climate as hazardous have hindered development efforts and may have been used by officials to justify failures or seek other opportunities.,"The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim that misrepresentations and exaggerations of West Africa's climate as hazardous have hindered development efforts and may have been used by officials to justify failures or seek other opportunities. The General History of Africa notes that West Africa was historically labeled as 'the White Man's Grave' due to its reputation for being unhealthy, which could have been perceived as a barrier to development. However, the textbook clarifies that this reputation did not prevent the establishment of European plantations in other tropical regions, nor did it deter serious applicants in West Africa. By the early twentieth century, advancements in controlling malaria and other tropical diseases were improving the region's reputation. The textbook suggests that other factors, such as the lack of mineral wealth and the success of local farmers, played more significant roles in hindering development. In contrast, The African Times articles emphasize that the climate's negative reputation was often exaggerated and unfairly condemned, with many health issues stemming from personal neglect rather than the climate itself. These articles highlight that such misrepresentations contributed to prejudices against development and were sometimes exploited by officials, like Administrator O'Callaghan, to justify resignations or seek other opportunities. The articles argue that the climate is not more hazardous than other tropical regions and that proper care can mitigate health risks. Together, these sources suggest that while the climate's reputation may have been used to justify certain failures, it was not the sole or primary factor impeding development in West Africa.","The General History of Africa textbook provides some insights that relate to the claim about misrepresentations and exaggerations of West Africa's climate. The text mentions that West Africa was known as 'the White Man's Grave' due to its reputation for being unhealthy, which could have been perceived as a hindrance to development efforts. However, the textbook clarifies that this reputation did not prevent the establishment of European plantations in other tropical regions like the Belgian Congo and Malaya, nor did it deter serious applicants in West Africa. Furthermore, by the start of the twentieth century, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective, and the region's unsavory reputation was beginning to diminish. This suggests that while the climate's reputation may have been a factor, it was not the primary reason for the lack of development or the failure of plantation systems in West Africa. Instead, the text attributes these failures to other factors, such as the lack of mineral wealth, opposition from British firms, and the success of local farmers in meeting export demands. Therefore, while the climate's reputation might have been used to justify certain failures or decisions, the textbook emphasizes other more significant factors that influenced development efforts in the region.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that misrepresentations and exaggerations of West Africa's climate as hazardous have hindered development efforts and may have been used by officials to justify failures or seek other opportunities. The articles highlight that the climate of West Africa has been unfairly condemned without proper inquiry, with many deaths attributed to the climate actually resulting from personal neglect or intemperance. This misrepresentation is noted to have contributed to prejudices that obstruct efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa. Furthermore, the articles mention instances where officials, such as Administrator O'Callaghan, may have used the unfavorable reports of the climate to justify resignations or seek other posts, despite evidence of long-term European residents maintaining good health. Additionally, the articles argue that the climate is not more hazardous than other tropical regions and that proper care and precautions can mitigate health risks.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either. Furthermore, the control of malaria and other tropical diseases was becoming more effective by the start of the twentieth century, and the so-called White Man's Grave was begin› ning to lose some of its unsavoury reputation. 20 What then did prevent the wholesale alienation of land in British West Africa? The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.578, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'Ethiopianism', 'content': ""In West Africa, however, the educated elite did not stop short at political action. They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

In both the French and British colonies, the end of the nineteenth century was marked by a systematic frustration of westernized Africans' expectations. As A. E. Afigbo has correctly observed,$^{7}$ the end of the nine› teenth century in the colonies of British West Africa witnessed not just the systematic removal of educated Africans who had held positions of responsibility in the earlier decades: the same period also saw the systematic tightening of conditions under which Africans could become French citizens in Senegal and elsewhere.

To be sure, they had a better knowledge of their country, and the severity of the climate, which forced the Europeans to suspend operations during certain periods of the year, occasionally provided them with some respite. But the bulk of the conquering troops were Africans officered by Europeans. Hence these riflemen were not out of their element. Frequently the West Africans, like the Maghribians (see Chapter 5) did not even have the advantage of greater numbers. Often behind the regular troops of the invaders, there marched thousands of African auxiliaries from annexed or protected territories whose chief function was systematically to pillage the country in conflict with their protector so as to disrupt its internal organization. Moreover, the West African states never succeeded in setting up an organic alliance that would compel their enemies to do battle simultaneously on several fronts. Certain states clearly perceived the necessity for this, but their attempts to bring it about came to naught. Most of the resisters resorted to guerrilla warfare too late, when they had learned through defeat that neither conventional warfare nor the defensive systems of the 'tatas' left them any chance of success in the face of enemies possessing weapons capable of greater destruction. To all that must be added the fact, already pointed out above, that in 1890 the imperialists, by the Brussels Convention, reached an agreement that no further arms should be sold to Africans. Thereafter, the Africans encountered severe logistic problems.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—'}, {'id': 299, 'article_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'full_section_title': 'The (Colony of the) Gold Coast', 'last_edit_date': '01-23-1864', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1864#article-14', 'issue_date': '23_01_1864', 'content': 'This position altogether is so far clear. But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': '""The sanitary condition of the town of Cape Coast, and indeed of all the towns upon the seaboard, is deplorable.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""These explanations and arguments in respect of shortage of personnel and the need to reduce cost to the barest minimum are themselves directly related to a more fundamental problem which dictated the adoption of the conjunctive system of administration by all the colonial governments in the twentieth century.

Whether in respect of the French in the Four Communes of Senegal or of the British with regards to the Crown colonies of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast (now Ghana) and Lagos (in what is now Nigeria), assimilation had, by the end of the nineteenth century, been frustrated not only by the cultural resistance of the African peoples concerned.

These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel.

The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

African intellectuals there found it more difficult to play the role of inter› mediaries.\nAnother crucial distinguishing feature of anti-colonial protest in Southern Africa lies in the fact that opposition to the colonial order was recruited, not only from among Africans, but from among the sizeable non-African populations - the 'coloured people', Indians and progressive whites. Consequently, Africans were the main but not the sole anti-colonial force, and this left its imprint on the whole character of the struggle. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.673, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.666, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in West Africa, 1880-1914', 'section_title': 'African Reactions and Responses in West Africa, > Elite associations', 'content': ""Many clubs and associations were also formed by the educated Africans mainly in the urban centres as vehicles for protest against the abuse and iniquities of colonial systems during this period.

The ARPS was easily the most active. It was formed to protest against the Land Bill of 1896 which was to give control of all so-called waste or unoccupied lands to the government. As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910. It was certainly the most successful of the mouthpieces of the elite and traditional rulers of West Africa and the greatest opponent of colonialism until the formation of the National Congress of British West Africa after the First World War. In French West Africa, the Young Senegalese Club formed in 1910 also actively campaigned for equal rights.\nIt should be evident from this discussion that the peoples of West Africa devised all kinds of strategies and tactics first to oppose the establish› ment of the colonial system and second, after the failure of their early efforts, to resist certain specific measures and institutions of the system. These various strategies and measures proved on the whole unsuccessful, and by the end of the period under review, colonialism had become firmly entrenched in the whole of West Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In general, colonialism requires a social base for its survival.

Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.659, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the New World', 'section_title': 'The educational impact of the Americas', 'content': ""While travelling in West and Southern Africa with the Phelps-Stokes Commission and while lecturing in the Gold Coast as part of his Achimota appointment, Aggrey and several others in similar ways reached across many African communities and prompted dozens of African youth to seek an American rather than a British education.

Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

For not only is the time of service on that coast doubly reckoned, but they enjoy besides the substantial advantage of private practice. This advantage they do not enjoy in the West Indies, private practice being in the hands of the civil medical practitioners. That the emoluments from this source are considerable, may be judged of by the fact that the late colonial surgeon of Sierra Leone is understood to have realised the handsome sum of 20,000l., and the yearly income of the present colonial surgeon of that colony from official and private practice is, as has been stated by himself and friends, 1,200l. or 1,500l. per annum. We are glad, therefore, to know that some of the native gentlemen are educating their sons to the medical profession. A beginning has been made in this direction, Messrs. Smith and Spilsberry being far advanced medical students at King's College, and the appointment to staff-assistant-surgeoncies of Drs. Davis and Horton is a proof that the Government is alive to the advantages of having coloured medical officers attached to the regiments stationed in West Africa. Strangely, however, their appointment is viewed almost as an intrusion by some of their European professional brethren on the coast, and we have heard it rumoured that one of these medical gentlemen had it even in contemplation to resign his commission rather than subject himself to the passive, but not less harassing annoyances to which he had been subjected. Be that as it may, it is of importance that every encouragement should be held out by the Government to native gentlemen who have qualified themselves to hold appointments either in the army or colonial medical service in West Africa.

This assertion we emphatically deny, and beg to record our protest against it.

To assert, therefore, that the advice of native medical officers would not be esteemed, is the flimsiest of pretences. From all we have learnt, we suspect that the true reason of the opposition offered by European medical officers on this head may be traced to their natural apprehension that the lucrative field of private practice, now in the hands of a few, would be greatly diminished when black or coloured medical gentlemen come to contest it with them.""}, {'id': 189, 'article_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'full_section_title': 'On the Climate and Diseases of West Africa', 'last_edit_date': '06-23-1863', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_06_1863#article-22', 'issue_date': '23_06_1863', 'content': ""Apart from such paltry considerations, we strenuously advocate their appointment as army and colonial medical officers on the coast, because, in a financial point of view, such appointments would save the large sum of money which at present is annually expended in providing European medical officers with passages to and from the coast.

His Excellency has done more in the short space of two years for the benefit of Africa than Blackall ever did throughout his five years' administration. A native has been appointed Colonial Surgeon for the Gambia; a native pastor has been called to fill the post of Chaplain for the same settlement; and now a pure son of the soil is selected to legislate for his country. It may be said that it was in Governor Blackall's time that the Honourable John Ezzidio obtained a seat in Council, but what of that? Surely it was not in accordance with Major Blackall's wishes. He strenuously sought to get a minion of his own placed in Mr. Ezzidio's position; but the Chamber of Commerce, who elected Mr. Ezzidio, and who were determined to assert their right, returned Mr. Ezzidio as one most capable of understanding and defending their interests. Major Blackall found himself completely frustrated in this matter, and was therefore compelled to yield. —*West African Liberator.*\n\n*(From an Occasional Correspondent.)*  \nFreetown, Sierra Leone, January 1, 1870.""}, {'id': 2884, 'article_title': 'OFFICIAL', 'full_section_title': 'OFFICIAL', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1875#article-17', 'issue_date': '01_06_1875', 'content': '## OFFICIAL.\n\n**COLONIAL-OFFICE, DOWNING-STREET, May 28.** — The Queen has been graciously pleased to give orders for the appointment to the most distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, of Captain George Cumine Strahan, R.A., Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Gold Coast Colony, to be an Ordinary Member of the Third Class, or Companion of the said Order. — *London Gazette, May 28.*\n\n**MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.** — To be Surgeon-Major in the Army: Surgeon James Africanus Beale Horton, M.D., African Department; dated 1st April, 1875.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

We have numbers of women in good position in this colony, but they have as yet found no useful and satisfactory channel for their energies.

No grounds that we can perceive can justify such a step in face of the facts we are about to detail, and which incontestably prove that European medical officers (and others), instead of shrinking from service in West Africa, on the contrary, prefer the West Africa stations to those of the West Indies; and not unfrequently volunteer for the Coast. Indeed, the substantial privileges they enjoy in West Africa, in the shape of every year's service being doubly reckoned, besides the advantages of private practice—a privilege from which they are debarred in the West Indies, by private practice there being in the hands of civil medical practitioners—are, we affirm, keenly appreciated by them. There is no difficulty in proving this assertion. Beginning at the Gambia, we find that the present principal medical officer has already served twice on the Gold Coast, preferring to remain at the Gambia, and getting his appointment as surgeon to one of the West India regiments cancelled. In the same way Mr. M'D., who had been stationed on the Gold Coast, and at the Gambia, had his request granted to be relieved of the surgeoncy of a West India regiment, to return to the Coast, and it is well known that the late Mr. Brien most reluctantly accepted the appointment of surgeon to the 2nd West India Regiment, stationed at Barbadoes, where he was cut off by yellow fever, after having served once at the Gambia, and twice on the Gold Coast. Again, three of the staff assistant-surgeons have been stationed, two of them once on the Gold Coast, and one twice at the Gambia. We moreover find that Mr. Robertson, the present Colonial Secretary at the Gambia, had previously been Colonial Surgeon from 1835 to 1849, and is still in the enjoyment of good health. His successor as Colonial Surgeon retired on a comfortable pension, after a service of ten years; and the gentleman at present holding that office has now held it some four or five years. The present judge at the Gambia also commenced his official career, in 1837, as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, and has lived there, with the exception of occasional visits to England, from that time until now, in the enjoyment of a fair share of health. If we turn to Sierra Leone, we find that the late Colonial Surgeon lived there from 1831 to 1854, and in that long period went only twice home. The present Colonial Surgeon, whose appointment dates from January, 1856, had previously served as Staff Assistant-Surgeon at the Gambia and Sierra Leone, and with the exception of a severe attack of fever during the prevalence of the epidemic, or yellow fever, in 1859, has enjoyed good health. His brother, at present Assistant Colonial Surgeon, has likewise been appointed some time, and we are glad to know that his salary has been increased from 200l. to 300l. per annum, and that he is not restricted as preceding assistant colonial surgeons at Sierra Leone were from private practice.

619,"The success and recognition of Africans in professional fields both in West Africa and abroad challenged racial stereotypes and demonstrated their capabilities, countering prevalent prejudices.","The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles collectively provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that the success and recognition of Africans in professional fields, both in West Africa and abroad, challenged racial stereotypes and demonstrated their capabilities, thereby countering prevalent prejudices. The textbook highlights an intellectual revolution in West Africa, led by figures like James Africanus Horton and Edward Wilmot Blyden, who actively refuted racist ideas and advocated for African racial consciousness and pan-Africanism. Horton's works, for instance, argued against racial inferiority and emphasized the potential for African prominence in global history. The achievements of Afro-Americans in the Americas, such as establishing educational institutions and technological innovations, further illustrate the capabilities of Africans and their descendants. The emergence of an educated elite in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, and contributions from individuals like Samuel Ajayi Crowther and James Johnson, underscore the intellectual and professional accomplishments of Africans. Similarly, The African Times articles highlight the appointment of black and colored individuals to significant positions in Sierra Leone, such as Chief Justice and Colonial Secretary, and commend African professionals like Rev. Mr. Robin and Dr. John Africanus Beale Horton. These examples illustrate the capabilities and achievements of Africans, challenging racial stereotypes. The articles also mention the success of African merchants and the craftsmanship of native Africans in creating gold trinkets, further demonstrating their skills and ingenuity. Recognition of individuals like Mr. D. P.

The text highlights the intellectual revolution in West Africa, led by figures like James Africanus Horton and Edward Wilmot Blyden, who actively refuted racist ideas and advocated for African racial consciousness and pan-Africanism. Horton's works, for instance, argued against the notion of racial inferiority and emphasized the potential for African improvement and prominence in global history. Additionally, the achievements of Afro-Americans in the Americas, such as the establishment of educational institutions and technological innovations, further illustrate the capabilities of Africans and their descendants. The emergence of an educated elite in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, and the contributions of individuals like Samuel Ajayi Crowther and James Johnson, also underscore the intellectual and professional accomplishments of Africans. These examples collectively demonstrate how Africans and Afro-Americans challenged racial stereotypes and contributed significantly to various professional fields, thereby countering prevalent prejudices.","The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim that the success and recognition of Africans in professional fields both in West Africa and abroad challenged racial stereotypes and demonstrated their capabilities, countering prevalent prejudices. The articles highlight the appointment of black and colored individuals to significant positions in Sierra Leone, such as Chief Justice and Colonial Secretary, and the commendation of African professionals like Rev. Mr. Robin and Dr. John Africanus Beale Horton. These examples illustrate the capabilities and achievements of Africans in various professional fields, challenging the racial stereotypes of the time. Additionally, the articles mention the success of African merchants and the craftsmanship of native Africans in creating gold trinkets, further demonstrating their skills and ingenuity. The recognition of individuals like Mr. D. P. Hughes Taylor, who received professional education in England and was praised for his qualifications, also supports the claim.

They also set themselves the task of refuting and disproving racist ideas and practices in a series of articles, pamphlets, books and speeches, and it was this that gave rise to the second of the unique processes of the period, namely, the intellectual revolution and the accompanying birth of African racial consciousness, pan-Africanism and the concept of the African personality. The pioneers of this revolution in West Africa were undoubt› edly James Africanus Horton (1835-83) and Edward Wilmot Blyden (18321912). Among the works of Horton on the themes in question were Political Economy of British Western Africa, with the requirements of the several colonies and settlements: An African view of the Negro place in Nature (1865); West African Countries and Peoples: A Vindication of the African Race (1868); and Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast (1870). In West African Countries and Peoples, Horton refuted the idea of inherent racial inferiority of the black man by arguing that the difference in the stages of civilization between whites and blacks arose 'entirely from the influence of external circumstances'. To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

President Barclay of Liberia rejected Azikiwe's application with the curt reminder that he was not a Liberian and, therefore, knew rather less than required about the republic to discharge the duties in question. With characteristic zeal, however, Azikiwe set out to make himself such an authority on Liberia that even the Americo-Liberian citizenry would be envious.

What appears to have occurred, particu› larly among Africans in British colonies, was an altered perspective of the American-educated African colliding with an inhospitable colonial reception (which was prompted by educational experiences completely outside the colonial orbit). 47 American education, however, was not universally or categorically opposed or disdained in the African colonies. Indications are that industrial or vocational training was welcomed by the colonial entrepreneur since it enabled him to secure well-trained artisans to drive motor lorries, build his houses, and manage his mechanical or electrical plant. Government officials and white missionaries encouraged this kind of training for different reasons: government officials because they believed that the commercial and economic development of the territory would be advanced, missionaries because they believed that Booker T.

The much-heralded black emigration schemes trumpeted by Garvey, whose ubiquitous publications reached deep into Africa, were only one example of a leitmotif which brought American blacks within the world view of African peoples. The themes of African redemption through American black missionaries were another.\nAfricans themselves, however, created the context of their next interaction with American blacks as they matriculated at American, largely Afro-American, schools and attended pan-African conferences and the like. Consequently, many Africans underwent a technical-educationalpolitical experience alien to their colonial world. When they re-entered their own worlds, many felt driven to resolve questions of ideology, cultural definition, educational values, political power, and pan-African unity or consciousness, guided by new perspectives.\nViewed against such an historical backdrop, the numerous pan-African conferences, Tuskegean educational and technical projects, the nØgritude movement and the occasional focus on American blacks in African millen› nial dreams, all illustrate the consistency of the pan-African theme among American and Caribbean blacks.

Blyden concluded: During all the years which have elapsed since the commencement of modern progress, the African race has filled a very humble and subordinate part in the work of human civilization. But the march of events is developing the interesting fact that there is a career before this people which no other people can enter upon. There is a peculiar work for them to accomplish, both in the land of their bondage, and in the land of their fathers, which no other people can achieve. With the present prospects and privileges before his race - with the chances of arduous work, noble suffering, and magnificent achievement before them - I would rather be a member of this race than a Greek in the time of Alexander, a Roman in the Augustin period, or an AngloSaxon in the nineteenth century. 46 It was also Blyden who in his famous speech to the American Col› onization Society in May 1880 gave great publicity to the phrase 'Ethiopia Stretching Out her Hands Unto God' and equated Ethiopian with African; and it was he who first used the term 'African personality' in his lecture delivered on 19 May 1893 in Freetown when he described the African Race as 'a Great Race - great in its vitality, in its power of endurance and its prospect of perpetuity'. He continued: It is sad to think that there are some Africans, especially among those who have enjoyed the advantages of foreign training, who are so blind to the radical facts of humanity as to say, 'Let us do away with the sentiment of Race. Let us do away with our African personality and be if possible in another Race ...

The reputation and resources of Tuskegee, however, were brought to Africa by African and American alumni and, often, by numerous African visitors to Tuskegee or correspondents with Washington who had never been matriculated students.

An editor informed me that a friend of his who visited the Centennial advised him that he saw the gold trinkets from the Gold Coast, but he was told that those trinkets were made by the white settlers on the Gold Coast. I beg to deny this assertion _in toto_. In the first place, there are no white settlers on the West Coast of Africa, beginning from ""St. Mary\'s Bathurst, Gambia,"" to ""St. Paul de Loanda."" The few Europeans and Americans on that Coast are either Government officials, missionaries, or merchants. The large assortment of gold trinkets that are in the main building at the Centennial are as follows: Gold ear-rings, gold drops, gold bracelets, of various designs; gold hair-combs, gold crosses, gold brooches, in shapes of butterflies and other designs; gold rings, with the twelve signs of the Zodiac and numerous other designs; gold beads, gold studs, gold links, gold chains, gold necklaces, gold guards, gold dust, and other gold trinkets too numerous to mention; and these gold trinkets were made by the native Africans, some of whom cannot speak a word of the English language. In style of workmanship these trinkets are unequalled by anything made by civilized craftsmen the world over. Certainly there is nothing in this line in the Centennial that may be placed beside them; and when it is considered that they were wrought with rude tools, that the artizans were native men, unskilled in civilized art; that they and their fathers from time immemorial have ever lived on the Gold Coast, that they are the manufacturers of the largest assortment of trinkets in the Centennial,—then it seems to me that these men,—the ""Ashantees,"" the ""Accras,"" the ""Fantees,"" the ""Denkras,"" the ""Wassaws,"" the ""Assins,"" &c.,—should not be deprived of the meed of praise which belongs to them, but should receive the just reward for their great genius and their native art. I therefore, as an African, of which I am proud, having been born, bred and educated on that Coast, feel called upon to make this explanation. On several occasions while visiting the Centennial, I spent some time in explaining to the ladies and gentlemen who crowded around me that these trinkets were made by the native Africans, and I took great pains to impress upon their minds the capability and ingenuity of the native Africans. I would like very much that the words West Africa should be placed under the words Gold Coast, for many persons will think that the Gold Coast is in Australia or California, and thus deprive Africa of her just merits. Give to all nations, tribes, and people what is due to them.

Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

Dr. Blyden, a full-blooded Christian negro, recently the Liberian Minister at the Court of St. James, is an unexceptional witness.

Her Chamber of Deputies has granted the De Brazza mission, by a vote of 449 to 3, a credit of a million and a quarter of francs. The Portuguese Government has appointed explorers and examined the Congo country, and assumes to exercise control over all the territory at the mouth of the Congo. The German Reichstag has increased its annual appropriation for the exploration of Africa. Italy has despatched a party to Abyssinia for geographical and mercantile purposes. She has also concluded treaties which promise to make Assab a centre of commerce. The Sultan of Morocco has authorized Spain to take possession of Santa Cruz del Mar, and the Sultan of Zanzibar has purchased six superior steamers to constitute a regular coast service, in the interest of commerce and for the suppression of the slave-trade. The International African Association, which owes its origin to the philanthropic initiative of Leopold II., King of the Belgians, has received large subscriptions and pushed forward exploring expeditions to start and equip the line of hospitable and scientific stations which are to bound the East and West Coast, and form a civilizing girdle around Central Africa. And the results following the explorations of Livingstone and Stanley and De Brazza are attracting the attention of the civilized world. What was a \'Dark Continent,\' by the indomitable energy of these explorers, seems likely to prove the richest quarter of the globe. Not only does the land produce, with slight persuasion of tillage, admirable crops of cotton and coffee, but the soil is rich in diamonds on its southern coast, and in iron on its northern.

They also argue that the climate's reputation was exaggerated to protect monopolies held by merchants, discouraging competition. The articles highlight that many Europeans lived long and healthy lives in West Africa, suggesting the climate was not as deadly as portrayed, and criticize the neglect of sanitary measures and mismanagement by officials as contributing factors to health issues, rather than the climate itself.

As A. G. Hopkins has pointed out: The alleged unhealthiness of the tropics did not prevent the establish› ment of European plantations in the Belgian Congo, French Equatorial Africa, or Malaya, and it did not discourage serious applicants in West Africa either.

The first answer was what Hopkins has termed 'a fortuitous geo› logical fact', that West Africa was found to be not profusely rich in mineral deposits. The second was the failure of the move to establish plantations in West Africa. This failure was caused by a number of factors. The first was the vigorous opposition put up by the other British firms operating in these areas, which could not go in for the plantation system themselves. The second was the failure of the few plantations that were established owing to lack of capital and 'a considerable ignorance of tropical condition', shortage of labour and the shifts in world supply. The third and most important factor was the success of the West Africans themselves in meeting the demand for export crops such as cocoa, groundnuts and oil palm using their own simple methods on their small farms, which obviated the necessity of the plantation system in these areas. Another factor was the opposition that any attempt to seize any large areas or introduce large-scale forced labour for plantations would have generated among West Africans.$^{21}$ It was a combination of these factors that saved the people of British West Africa from the expropriation of their lands that was the fate of some of those in British East and Central Africa."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.604, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': 'In the 1870s, free trade was the slogan by which Europeans fought against the right of African rulers to regulate trade.$^{23}$ In the name of free trade, they sought more and more privileges for European traders.

Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the ""Dark Continent"" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'.

H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

But it was of little value 'in circumstances where survival depended essentially upon the ability of groups with shared resources to reconcile their politics to their economic interests through a fragmented, contradictory process of attack, compromise, and evasion'.$^{14}$ Although this conclusion is intended for the Dawi Mani, it might well apply to the history of many other Saharan societies."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.583, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance.

Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

The more the Mfengu saw themselves as being economically exploited by the Xhosa, the easier they would be to recruit as cheap farm labour.\nEven more serious still, as long as the Mfengu saw themselves as apart from the Xhosa and identified their interests and anxieties with those of the British colony, they were bound to physically move away from the Xhosa and join the British colony at the earliest opportunity. This oppor› tunity was eventually provided by the Sixth Frontier War (1834-5) when the Mfengu had to decide what position to adopt in a war that they at first regarded as a conflict between the British and the Xhosa. A meeting held immediately after the outbreak of the war resolved as follows: first that no Mfengu would take part in the invasion of the Colony; secondly, that as far as possible the Mfengu should defend and protect missionaries and traders; and, thirdly, that the Mfengu should act as British intelligence agents conveying security messages from John Ayliff to the British army commander, keeping him and his forces informed about the movements and intentions of the Xhosa forces.\nIndeed, from the beginning of the war in December 1834 to May 1835, when they left the Xhosa area to go and settle in British-controlled territory, the Mfengu had done a great deal of intelligence work for the British army and against the Xhosa.

From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

No grounds that we can perceive can justify such a step in face of the facts we are about to detail, and which incontestably prove that European medical officers (and others), instead of shrinking from service in West Africa, on the contrary, prefer the West Africa stations to those of the West Indies; and not unfrequently volunteer for the Coast. Indeed, the substantial privileges they enjoy in West Africa, in the shape of every year's service being doubly reckoned, besides the advantages of private practice—a privilege from which they are debarred in the West Indies, by private practice there being in the hands of civil medical practitioners—are, we affirm, keenly appreciated by them. There is no difficulty in proving this assertion. Beginning at the Gambia, we find that the present principal medical officer has already served twice on the Gold Coast, preferring to remain at the Gambia, and getting his appointment as surgeon to one of the West India regiments cancelled. In the same way Mr. M'D., who had been stationed on the Gold Coast, and at the Gambia, had his request granted to be relieved of the surgeoncy of a West India regiment, to return to the Coast, and it is well known that the late Mr. Brien most reluctantly accepted the appointment of surgeon to the 2nd West India Regiment, stationed at Barbadoes, where he was cut off by yellow fever, after having served once at the Gambia, and twice on the Gold Coast. Again, three of the staff assistant-surgeons have been stationed, two of them once on the Gold Coast, and one twice at the Gambia. We moreover find that Mr. Robertson, the present Colonial Secretary at the Gambia, had previously been Colonial Surgeon from 1835 to 1849, and is still in the enjoyment of good health. His successor as Colonial Surgeon retired on a comfortable pension, after a service of ten years; and the gentleman at present holding that office has now held it some four or five years. The present judge at the Gambia also commenced his official career, in 1837, as Assistant Colonial Surgeon, and has lived there, with the exception of occasional visits to England, from that time until now, in the enjoyment of a fair share of health. If we turn to Sierra Leone, we find that the late Colonial Surgeon lived there from 1831 to 1854, and in that long period went only twice home. The present Colonial Surgeon, whose appointment dates from January, 1856, had previously served as Staff Assistant-Surgeon at the Gambia and Sierra Leone, and with the exception of a severe attack of fever during the prevalence of the epidemic, or yellow fever, in 1859, has enjoyed good health. His brother, at present Assistant Colonial Surgeon, has likewise been appointed some time, and we are glad to know that his salary has been increased from 200l. to 300l. per annum, and that he is not restricted as preceding assistant colonial surgeons at Sierra Leone were from private practice. On the Gold Coast there is Mr. O'Callaghan, who has volunteered to serve there for the third time; and we can likewise adduce Mr. Clarke, who served many years both at Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.""}, {'id': 981, 'article_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'full_section_title': 'West Coast Climate—Yellow Fever—Army and Navy Mismanagement', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1866#article-27', 'issue_date': '23_11_1866', 'content': '\n\nWhy, this is worse than the ill-fated encampment in the bush at Prahsu, during the so-called Ashantee campaign—a mortality there which led to the assembly of a Parliamentary committee, and the all but abandonment by us of the Protected Territories on the Gold Coast, and other West African colonies and settlements.

It is with Western Africa that the inhabitants and commerce of the United Kingdom are more exclusively concerned. Our possessions there are becoming more and more a necessity to the trade of Liverpool, Manchester, Burnley, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, and London.\n\nAt this moment there are thousands of men hungering for a fresh field of enterprise. Fate will smile on them if we only tackle West Africa in a proper manner, instead of leaving it in the hands of a few merchants, who, to keep the trade to themselves, give out that the climate is unhealthy. A merchant in the City, trading with West Africa, said to me the other day, that if I opened men\'s eyes to West Africa\'s material wealth and salubrity of climate I should ruin their monopoly.\n\nAs to climate, Lieut.-Colonel de Ruvigne reports as follows in the Official Blue-Book: ""All those who are ignorant of the real facts as regards climate, nature of country, &c., imagine there are greater difficulties than really exist. I have to observe that many officers, myself included, served, without detriment to their health or constitution, in West Africa from January 1858 to December 1863; and I can safely say that it was alone during periods of utter inaction on the coast that I suffered from illness, though when in the thick bush of the Fanti Country, bordering on Ashanti, with privations and long marches, I felt no ill-effects, neither did any of the officers who served under my commission.""\n\nTurning to Blue Book (C. 6,270) of this year, we find the the Governor, Sir W. Branford Griffith, reporting as follows: ""After several years of residence in this Colony—Gold Coast—in the promotion of whose interests I have not only had the distinguished honour, but also as a labour of love, to take part, I am full of hope for the present and future of this grand, vast, and magnificent Colony. I do not wish to advertise it. Its natural wealth and other advantages are enormous, and must sooner, rather than later, attract attention, and draw capital to the country, which, while benefiting the investors, will tend to the continued and increasing development of the natural resources of the Colony.""\n\nBy stamping out the drink curse with courage, determination, and vigour; by proving that, as Christians, we can keep to the spirit of our religion and make it a living power, we shall not only help forward the cause of humanity, but gain a market for our manufactures second to none in the world.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF BATHURST, &c.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—We regret that there have been false representations of the climate of Western Africa, especially the settlement on the Gambia. It is true that some of the officials that had been sent to the Gambia suffered much on account of the climate, but many of them (without disrespect) took advantage of the unfavourable report of the West Coast. We saw in the African Times of May 23rd, 1873, that Mr. Quin and others had an interview with the Earl of Kimberley about the affairs on the West Coast, but we were surprised to see that the Administrator, O\'Callaghan, ""had been compelled by ill health to resign."" We admit that Colonel Anton\'s health was totally ruined, which was the cause of his death; but if the life he led there had been closely watched, the authorities would not have come to the conclusion that he was affected by the climate. When the Administrator arrived here and saw the defenceless state of the Gambia, he thought of organizing a kind of Volunteer force; but this was without success. In fact, Mrs. O\'Callaghan was so very much dissatisfied and frightened at the place, that she would be extremely alarmed on hearing the report of a gun, and even the rumbling of carriage wheels. We were very much dissatisfied when we heard that his Excellency, who was stouter than when he entered the Gambia, was ordered home because of ill health, not knowing that he was looking out for another post. He even promised that he would report the state of the settlement on his arrival in England, that measures might be taken to rectify every defect in the place. We could show many instances to prove that our climate is not so unhealthy that Europeans could not live twenty-eight, thirty, forty-four, and even fifty-five years in it. Messrs. Goddard, Brown, Robertson, Chown, Quin, and Chief Justice Mantell are living testimonies of this settlement. The first of these gentlemen was a merchant who amassed a fortune; he lived in Bathurst a period of about fifty-five years, returned home, and died at the age of seventy-eight. The second, who is now in Bathurst, carrying on an extensive business, has been here for forty-four years, and his health, we venture to say, is improving every day. The third, who was the Colonial Surgeon and afterwards Secretary, resided in this settlement for thirty years, and has now retired to Scotland. The fourth, who was a merchant, took a residence in this place for twenty-five years, and returned home with a fortune. The fifth was of the same calling, resided here for the space of twenty-two years, made his fortune, and has taken his abode in England. The Chief Justice, also, stationed in this colony for twenty-eight years, is now holding a situation as a magistrate in England. Lawyer Montague, Smith and others are living testimonies of ""unhealthy"" Sierra Leone. There are others who might have been testimonies on behalf of the West Coast, but many of them died accidentally. We may therefore come to the conclusion that the climate on the West Coast is not altogether unhealthy.

Yes, here is new evidence of the fact, that the denunciations hurled by the families of victims, and by journalists ignorant in these matters, upon the climate of certain portions of the globe under British rule or power, in which British soldiers, sailors, and civilians have to serve, ought rather to be heaped on the authorities who so unnecessarily and wantonly sacrifice the lives of their fellow-subjects and fellow-servants.

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

But we have been subject to such misrepresentations when combating stereotyped misstatements as regards West Africa, that we will not allow any one to misunderstand us. The opinions we put forward with regard to the climate of West Africa have not been hastily or crudely formed, nor have they been adopted to serve some temporary or interested purpose. They are the result of evidence that cannot be disproved. They are promulgated by us to remove prejudices which war against our efforts for the advancement of civilization in Africa, and because we feel that they are pregnant with most practical results. We do not, for instance, pretend that the West African climate is not unhealthy. We admit that it is. But we as fearlessly contend that it is not one whit more unhealthy for Europeans than many of the West India Islands, or than Hong Kong, China, or India, &c. These regions are equally liable to visitations of epidemic disease as is West Africa, in the shape of yellow fever, dysentery, &c. We are, moreover, firmly convinced that if ever the day arrives when complete, and not mere partial statistical tables, are compiled, showing the mortality amongst Europeans at the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast, and even the new settlement at Lagos, the facts fairly and impartially revealed will demonstrate that at least a moiety of the deaths which occur amongst them are not the result of climatic disease, but are chargeable occasionally to accident; more frequently to a lamentable and wanton neglect of ordinary care and precautions; and too often to reckless indulgences, which will in any climate sap the springs of life, and ultimately destroy it. As additional evidences in support of these statements, take, for example, the records with regard to the numerous governors who have served, or are now serving, in West Africa. We find that in most instances they were and are men who had passed middle life before being called upon to administer those Governments, and were consequently far less able to bear up against attacks of fever. Yet, of the thirty-four gentlemen who have governed Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1864, seven only died there in that long period of seventy-two years. Of those seven, one was killed in action, another veteran most unwisely made fruit and vegetables his sole diet; and one of them had previously lived upwards of thirty-five years in the colony, dying at sea, not of disease incident to the climate, but of cancer of the stomach.

We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another.""

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.599, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Sir Alfred Moloney on West Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In West Africa, it must be acknowledged, we have at times to deal with exceptional conditions of peoples and things, and Governors have not only an anxious time of it, apart from the climate, but get it hot all round.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce? What is religion but an exalted form of civilization?

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE SOUTH-WEST COAST.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'The remaining Portuguese possessions on this coast call for little notice. That Power has at the present time an area of something like 380,000 square miles of territory in this part of the world, most of which she is content to nominally hold without making any serious attempt to really govern or improve. But still her greed continues; the recent Berlin Conference materially extended her possessions, and yet she thirsts for more territory. I am in hopes that at no far distant day some means or other will be found to relieve this corrupt and decaying Power of the greater portion of this territory, which she is both morally, physically, and financially unable to govern or develop. What the whole of West Africa wants is railways, where rivers are not, as well as from the heads of navigation into the interior in order to develop trade. These lands can grow anything tropical if labour can be found or the people induced to work: thus produce will increase, and goods in return follow, and by the adoption of modern means of transit, the vast interior will be opened out and become so well known that we may hope that in the next century invalids obliged to winter south will be able to take a through ticket, land at the Congo, proceed by a river steamer up to a railway, run across to the Nyanzas, and then go on to Gondokoro, and down the Nile to Cairo. At present the male African takes no thought for the morrow: time is not of the slightest value to him, want of food does not trouble him.

The palm supplies materials for building houses, the thick stems of leaves form uprights, the thinner ones walls, and the leaves yield waterproof thatch. The stems are also made into beds, sofas, chairs and tables; the fibre forms thick rope or thin cord, and the latter is used for fishing lines and nets, or woven into mats, or mixed with cotton into durable cloth. The palm tree also supplies oil, and fruit to eat and wine to drink. Cotton is indigenous, and capable of cultivation in vast regions. Of huge trees canoes are made, and gourds, varying in size and shape from a drinking cup to the largest size of wash-basin, answer for many domestic uses. The art of pottery, fashioned after the manner of ancient Egyptian models, is prevalent everywhere. The crude manufacture of iron from ore has been practised since man existed. Wild animals, domestic animals, and birds abound. Fruits of the earth grow spontaneously or with little cultivation, so that wherever rivers run the land may be truly said to overflow with milk and honey.

760,The portrayal and persistence of human sacrifices in Africa reveal both the limited impact of European influence on local customs and the need for critical examination of potentially biased European accounts.,"The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a nuanced perspective on the claim regarding the portrayal and persistence of human sacrifices in Africa and the impact of European influence. The General History of Africa suggests that while certain customs, such as human sacrifice, were discarded or modified during the colonial period, indicating some European impact, African cultures demonstrated resilience and adaptability, with many indigenous practices surviving or blending with European values. This highlights the potential bias in European accounts, which often depicted African societies as stagnant or barbaric, underscoring the need for critical examination of these narratives. Similarly, The African Times articles describe instances of human sacrifices in regions like Dahomey and the Bight of Biafra, supporting the notion that European influence had limited success in eradicating such practices. However, they also point out the potential exaggeration or inaccuracy in European reports, as exemplified by Prince Ademuyiwa's denial of such practices in Jebu Remo. Furthermore, the articles critique the negative aspects of European commerce, such as the slave and gin trades, overshadowing any positive impact. Both sources emphasize the importance of scrutinizing historical narratives, acknowledging both the impact of European influence and the persistence of African cultural practices, thus providing a balanced view that both corroborates and questions the claim.","The General History of Africa textbook provides some context that can be associated with the claim regarding human sacrifices and European influence.

As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The significance of colonialism for Africa', 'content': ""On the other hand, in the cultural and social field, the impact of colonial› ism was relatively neither profound nor permanent. Such changes as were introduced in the cultural field, such racial discrimination as was practised, and such condemnation of African culture as was preached even in the heyday of colonialism, were all confined primarily to the coastal areas and the urban centres, and never penetrated into the rural areas where life ran gaily on very much as before. African dance, art, music and traditional religious systems held their own and such borrowings and adaptations as were made by Africans were not only selective but also, to borrow M. J. Herskovits' terminology, 'additive' and not necessarily 'substitutive'. 56 Thus, in the rural areas and even to some extent in the urban ones, new beliefs, new gods, new utensils, new artefacts and new objects were added to the old ones. Certainly, in these areas, many Christians did and still do retain their belief in their traditional gods. Indeed, in the field of religion, if anything, it was the European religion that was rather Africanized as is obvious from the rituals, hymns, music and even doctrines of some of the syncretic and millenarian churches and not the other way round. What is even more important, the ground that was lost even in the urban centres in the field of culture has virtually been regained. Today, African art, music and dance are not only taught in educational institutions of all kinds but are now in boom in Africa and gaining recognition in Europe.

There were manifold variations in the reaction of African cultures to western innova› tions. Not only were certain customs and beliefs discarded or modified, but some were retained at one level of society at the same time as new alternatives were being accepted at another level. Thus while human sacrifice, the slave trade and the killing of twins were discarded in societies where such practices had existed, and old and new ideas were amalgamated in the sphere of religion, the European ideal of monogamous marriage, accepted as part of an expected public image by sections of the westernized elite, exists side by side under the law with the institution of polygamy among the urban and rural masses. Today we have existing side by side in Africa indigenous and European architectural traditions; local ethnicity and nationalism; local and regional-locked economies and a notional money economy; rural and urban life; western bureaucratic institutions and traditional local authorities; Ku\'ranic and Western schools.\nThus with ease many indigenous African institutions and ideas survived the impact of, or even blended with, alien European values. There is, for instance, the case of the Igbo who are often regarded as having massively embraced western ways. According to Sylvia Leith-Ross, an Igbo in the 1930s would - with disengaging facility - patronize holy communion and traditional magic and medicine, and plant \'side by side in the garden round his new cement and pan-roofed house the hibiscus of ""civilization"" and the ogirisi tree of pagan family rites\'. $^{1}$ Margaret Read has shown how the Nguni integrated the Christian Church and western education into their society, using both as instruments for further ensuring the survival of their culture in the modern world.

On the other hand, in Jamaica, with the Sasabonsan cult, of Asante origin, elements of \'African culture\' persisted during that historical period, subsequently vanishing to give way to spirit-based cults involving a large dose of magic, as was the case in 1894 of the \'Jamaica Baptist Free Church\', a sect founded by Bed ward.\nIn those parts of the Americas exposed to the teachings of Catholicism, a form of syncretism based on the co-existence of European and African cultural features arose.

This approach was used by Octavio Ianni and Fernando Henrique Cardoso$^{69}$ to study the process by which former slaves entered the free labour market and, subsequently, their integration into the urban economy.\nThis type of analysis makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which the population of African origin is integrated in the economic systems and societies of South America. However, it leaves on one side the continuing prestige of African cultural values in the New World, although of course one may hold the view that this can only be measured by using a racial criterion or that it is not an important variable.\nHere there are two conflicting schools of thought. The position taken by M. J. Herskovits$^{70}$ regarding the 'reinterpretation' of African culture as reflected in continuing cultural elements, provoked the black North American sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier$^{7}$ ' to draw attention to the central problem of integration in society as a whole. As Frazier saw it, Herskovits' theory could lead to the conclusion that the persistence of African cultural values might be regarded as evidence supporting the racialist argument that blacks cannot be assimilated. In the United States, on account of various factors including the work of the Protestant churches, the former slaves lost most of their traditional African cultural values and became part of the Anglo-Saxon cultural world.\nThe parallel between North America and South America and the Caribbean in terms of the African presence and particularly of African cultural values is not conclusive, for the situations were very different in view of the different ways in which the former slaves became 'integrated' in those regions, even from one country to another.\nFrom the cultural standpoint, whereas in the United States conversion to the Protestant religion led to the forsaking of cultural traditions and to the emergence of a new outlook, in Latin America and the Caribbean African cultural values persisted to varying degrees or underwent a process of transformation.\nMethodologically, two forms of presence should be distinguished: the cultural presence of Africa and the Negro presence in the physical sense.

Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself.

They saw a number of natives in a group, and went to the spot to see what was taking place. To their horror they saw a native tied by the feet and neck. The rope to the neck was thrown over a tree in one direction, and the rope attached to the feet was tied to a tree in the opposite direction. The ropes were then drawn tightly, and when the body was distended to its utmost length, another native with a hatchet struck the neck, and severed the head from the body. The head was taken to the grave where the King was lying, whilst the body was eaten by the natives.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

Human sacrifice may have been practised in the days of yore, but such a thing has not happened for years: indeed, the Government consider it a crime, punishable by law. As regards slavery, Sir G. T. Carter, in a recent interview he had with the kings and chiefs of Jebu Remo, said: ""No Englishman approves of slavery, because it is repugnant to his principles, but I have been among you long enough now to know the difference between my country and yours.

Captain Allen, in the treaties made by him, in 1840, with the kings and chiefs of nearly every town in the Bight of Biafra, inserted a clause for the prevention of human sacrifices. The mere marks of unlettered savages—many, or most of whom, would sign anything for a bottle of rum—cannot be considered binding, unless the signatories are from time to time reminded of what they have promised by affixing them. This was sufficiently proved in this river when King Bell killed several innocent men, and exhibited, in a sort of triumphal procession, their bleeding heads and dismembered limbs under the very eyes of the British representative. King Bell denied all knowledge of the treaty of 1840, which it would have been out of his power to have done if, on the periodical visits of the Consul, it had been read to the whole of the chiefs, assembled for the purpose. On the occasion that I speak of King Bell was fined for his murderous act, and King Aqua\'s house destroyed, because—and with some show of reason—he and his subordinate chiefs had refused to sign a new treaty, while the old treaty had not, by them, been violated. The signatures of King Aqua and his chiefs were forced from them at the muzzle of a 32-pounder. But, in six weeks afterwards, King Aqua might have been seen, attired in the height of African grotesqueness, dancing upon an elevated platform in his large canoe, while a bleeding head and arm were passed from hand to hand, amid the extreme glorification of those forming his crew. No proper notice was taken of this flagrant violation of the recently-renewed treaty; consequently, three more of these revolting sacrifices have taken place this year, two of them within the last three weeks. In using the word ""revolting,"" I use it in its strongest sense, as these wretched victims are not prisoners taken in open war, but are sneakingly kidnapped, without danger to the captors, from some insignificant village, whose subsequent vengeance is not dreaded, and whose trade is not a matter of consequence.\n\nIt is anything but creditable to our country that such horrors should take place within a few miles of an established consulate.

In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes.""

It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages. This ""Compendium"" meets such desires, and gets rid of such difficulties, offering as a prize to be gained by a few leisure hours\' reading all that it is essential well-educated people should know of this great continent. The degree of knowledge thus to be obtained may lead some whose attention has not hitherto been called in that direction to desires and sympathies with regard to that long-neglected quarter of the world, and its wretched populations. We therefore hail its appearance with great pleasure, and strongly recommend ""Stanford\'s Compendium—Africa"" to our readers. The educated Africans of the West Coast ought all to possess it, as in it they will see what Africa really is throughout, and the opinions current respecting it and themselves. Some of these opinions are not at all flattering, and wherever our friends can show them to be unjust we shall be glad to help in correcting them through our columns.', 'last_edit_date': '1878-04-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_04_1878#article-24', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CHRISTIAN MISSIONS IN AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""The Rev. J. P. Farler, of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, has made a spirited reply to Professor Lenz's attack on British missions in that region. Dr. Lenz returned in the spring from a journey across Africa. In the course of a sketch of his expedition he expressed an opinion that the outlay of vigour and money on the conversion of the natives is worse than thrown away. The negroes who persevere in Christianity, he declares, become disdainful of manual labour. They prefer to occupy themselves with noisy prayer meetings during their intervals of exertion. Most of their time is spent in loitering and in begging of white men. Their general destination, he alleges, is vagabondism, after which they abandon Christianity altogether, and turn professional criminals. Now Mr. Farler shows that Dr. Lenz has brought a universal indictment against missions in Africa, though the limits of his experience prove he is entitled to speak only of a portion. But Mr. Farler has no inclination to leave the Tanganyika and Nyassa settlements, which Dr. Lenz had opportunities of inspecting, under obloquy. He appeals to the effects produced in every locality in which missions have been established, in evidence that the results have not been small, and still less pernicious. To the magnitude of the difficulties the distinction achieved by travellers such as Dr. Lenz testifies. As Mr. Farler says, the explorer traverses the continent with all possible speed. His intercourse with the natives is confined to the employment of them for his own service. Their habits and moral condition are no concern of his. After a year or two he comes back to Europe, to be glorified by all classes of society. Mr. Farler does not deny the courageous traveller has borne hardships; but he asks, if that be praiseworthy, what is the due of Englishmen who expatriate themselves for life in the Dark Continent, not to learn its ways, but to purify them? If there be some meagreness in the results attained, he points out that the obstacles to be overcome are enormous. He refers to facts which no African traveller will gainsay in confirmation of his statement that much has been done, and in a manner which indicates the possibility of more hereafter."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.628, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""DR.

Unlike most of his predecessors in the task of crossing Africa from sea to sea, Dr. Lenz has never been for any length of time cut off from communication with Europe. Either along the Congo or by means of the Arab traders, Dr. Lenz has been able to send home letters describing the several stages of his journey. The district traversed by him is no longer in the barbarous and savage condition in which Mr. Stanley found it only a few years ago. The native tribes have receded before the advance of European settlements from the Western coast, and the Arab trading establishments from the Eastern, and a form of civilization greatly in advance of anything which the native tribes could exhibit has been established in a region which in Livingstone's time was unknown and impenetrable to the outer world. Dr. Lenz's journey was accomplished throughout without the necessity having once arisen for the use of fire-arms in self-defence against any human being. It must not of course be inferred from this that Central Africa is in all respects a safe place for an unarmed traveller to venture in. Dr. Lenz's route followed the track of advancing civilization, and traversed regions which are comparatively well known.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.611, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid.

It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

It makes sense, as Boahen has suggested, to see the events of the time and their key actors in terms of diplomacy, pursued independently or backed by force. To appreciate the extent to which diplomacy could go, it is necessary to understand the socio-economic forces operating in a particular society at the time of the encounter. For East Africa, a survey of such factors in the 1890s will be an appropriate setting for the events that followed. But, as R. I. Rotberg and Ali Mazrui state: 'There is no gainsaying that the introduction of Western norms and power and accompanying controls was everywhere in Africa questioned by the people affected'. 2 This questioning, however, took various forms. 'The response to the in› vasion was determined by the structure of each society at the time. Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments.

Most of the post-primary institutions were found in the main urban centres and in some countries most of the secondary schools were found in one town.

No less an authority than the Governor of the Gold Coast from 1919 to 1927, Sir Gordon Guggisberg, testified in 1920: 'One of the greatest mistakes of the education in the past has been this, that it has taught the African to become a European instead of remaining African. This is entirely wrong and the Government recognizes it. In future, our education will aim at making an African remain an African and taking interest in his own country.' 39 But though Guggisberg did establish Achimota College to make good this promise, not much was achieved since education in the country con› tinued to be controlled by the Christian missions whose primary aim was to produce people who could read the Bible in English or in the vernacular as well as teachers and priests."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': 'Colonial rule and structure', 'content': ""Throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the inter-war period, the chief became an administrative agent and not a 'native authority' and his traditional roles and powers were greatly weakened or curtailed. This shift in position, even in regions submitted to indirect rule, is easily explained.

Where there appeared to European eyes no satisfactory individuals in positions of traditional authority, other personnel, such as veterans, non-commissioned officers or clerks, were installed as chiefs. This was especially the case in French and Portuguese colonies where the local roles for the recruitment of personnel for chief› taincy positions were more often than not violated.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies.

The Sokoto caliphate and the Borno empire lost large tracts of territory by the time the boundaries of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria emerged. In the case of the 'peripatetic empires' of Samori TurØ and Rabi ibn Fadlallah, these were simply parcelled out between adjoining colonies. The secondary empires of Msiri and Tippu Tib in Central Africa were similarly shared out among the Belgians, the Portuguese and the British. The imposed boundaries of the colonies fossilized under the dead hand of colonialism and international law to become the international boundaries of independent African states to which the liberties and rights of whole peoples are at times sacrificed. It is now impossible to contemplate a significant change in any one of these boundary lines without a major upheaval. Events in the Horn of Africa are beginning to suggest that these imaginary lines on the map of Africa are eternal.\nAnother aspect of the new political structure deserving mention was the imposition of an alien European bureaucratic administrative structure on the pre-existing African political systems. Between the European and African structures there existed a wide range of patterns of relationship. Taking our examples from the policies of the two leading colonial powers of the period (Britain and France) we discover there were even variations within each system. The French were less concerned than the British with maintaining intact the empires, kingdoms and chiefdoms they conquered and using their political systems in local administration. Therefore they tended to break up the old paramountcies, pensioning off their rulers, while the British made an effort to hitch the local rulers and their political systems to their wagon of imperial administration. This was the general pattern. But in Morocco the French made an effort to preserve the king and his political system and to use them in administration, while for nearly three decades in Asante in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and for nearly two in Benin in Nigeria, the British sought to break the indigenous administrative systems of these two empires. 3"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.598, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African politics and nationalism, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The expression of African nationalism and politics', 'content': 'The newspapers served as media for diffusing nationalist and anticolonial activities across frontiers.

There are male Ocrahs, and there are also female Ocrahs, the latter more properly called Crabahs. They are to be found, not only in the palaces of kings, but in the household of anybody and everybody who is wealthy enough or foolish enough to purchase a slave for the purpose. The Ocrah may sometimes be the friend of his master, and the Crabah of her mistress, but is not by any means necessarily so. The probability is, that he does possess the confidence of his master, and she of her mistress, for neither would have been selected had they not evinced, whilst young, unusual capabilities for the performance of the ordinary domestic duties attached to their office. The number of Ocrahs and Crabahs in one household vary according to the wealth or the folly of the master or mistress.

Colonel and Mrs. O\'Connor on a tour of military inspection! Colonel Ord on a tour of civil inspection! They were expected, of course.

We remembered that the Committee of the House of Commons, which is, we suppose, to be named next month, or in March, was first mooted in consequence of supposed extravagant doings at the Gold Coast; and it seemed a strange mode of beginning a wise economy to send out a special commissioner in a ship of war, to be entertained by the respective governors of our forts and settlements at sumptuous champagne banquets given in honour of the pasha with ever so many tails, and of the officers of the ship that conveys him. But it is of course all owing to our ignorance as unofficial persons; as individuals ignorant of the sublime and abstruse knowledge which resides wherever redtape rules and governs. We should be told, perhaps, on inquiry, that the ship costs nothing—she must be employed somewhere—there was a glut of coals at the several coaling stations, and the so enormously paid governors were suffering under such immense pecuniary accumulations, that a little depletion by means of sumptuous hospitality was desirable!

On occasion of the late disgraceful abuses in Cape Coast Prison we suggested that the commodore on the station should be ordered to land there, and hold an open court of inquiry. But for very good reasons, no doubt, this was not deemed to be the proper course. And yet it is only thus that any real and true information can be obtained. We remember to have heard, from good authority, too, that on occasion of a similar tour of inspection to that now making by Colonel Ord, the attention of the commissioner was about to be called to some administrative acts that were thought to be quite unjustifiable. But the commissioner was inexpressibly shocked that anyone should have thought it possible he could listen to such evidence! ""The Governor is a very particular friend of mine, and I cannot hear anything against him."" Of course there was no African Times in those days. We do not suppose for a moment that such an open avowal would be made now, even if Colonel Ord (which we would not for a moment insinuate) were capable of such conduct.

I may devote the time at this meeting to the more cheerful and useful object of considering the future of the Niger territories, and of the Company whose interests are so entirely bound up in their prosperity.

We have, indeed, occasionally received cuttings from lesser known newspapers, containing vague and often mutually destructive charges of mal administration, all of which we thought and think it best to leave unnoticed. The difficulty with Germany ended last autumn on the German Government taking the sensible course of sending a commissioner to travel in the territories with the view of inquiring into the assertions of its expelled subject, and generally into the methods and results of the Niger Government. We understand that his report is not yet delivered, or, at any rate, not yet published; but the open expression of his opinions to persons unconnected with the Company justifies me in stating that, having entered the territories with a prejudice due to the false reports so industriously circulated, he had been strongly impressed with the thoroughness of the administrative work already achieved in those vast inland regions. The British Government has also despatched a commissioner on its behalf to acquire independent information concerning the government of the Niger territories. We have not received any information as to the nature of his inquiries, nor on any matter connected with his mission, excepting the mere fact of his visiting the territories; but we await with perfect confidence his report to her Majesty's Government. Our interests cannot suffer—cannot, in fact, do otherwise than gain—from visits by independent, impartial travellers, whether official or otherwise. We have been chary in insisting, through the Press, on the great and peculiar difficulties inevitably attendant on the developing of Central Africa, and we have not said much about the success which has so far attended our operations.

In order that our readers may have some idea of the difficulties in the way of journalism where evils and errors are to be exposed with a view to effect a salutary change, we may state briefly what then occurred. We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned. But it was held by our publishers that there was sufficient to lead to identification; and that, therefore, as “the greater the truth the greater the libel,” they could not take the risk of allowing it to appear in our columns. We had no resource but to bow to the decision, and refrain from publishing it. As it was strongly confirmative of what we had stated in our leader above alluded to, we can scarcely say that we submitted with a good grace. And yet, considering the small amount of support received by us from the West Coast, where comparatively so few of our nominal subscribers think it necessary to pay for the African Times, we can have no doubt they were right in preventing us as well as themselves from incurring any risk of the expense of defending an action for libel. At the same time, we feel it to be quite impossible to submit to entire silence, and, without therefore stating any of the particulars that were considered objectionable, we will merely give a short description of the *modus operandi* observed in obtaining a verdict. “When this\n\nwitness for the defence stated a fact that was important for the prosecution, the solicitor for the defence winked to the interpreter (the gentleman setting as Judge knowing nothing of the language), who did not interpret it at all. The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them."" It may be said, perhaps, the jury were right. But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict. After our last month\'s leader we do not think it necessary to make any further observations on the above, merely adding that we could wish the report of the case as we have it were in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom, however, it does not belong to us to forward it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.64, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

The possibility of such a thing had never yet reached my brain. At last, in colloquy with an old friend upon the Coast, the idea started up, and after due discussion, we adopted it. I speak of morals. In intellect the black race is palpably superior, and it is fast advancing in the path of civilization.""—Vol. II., p. 73. As the author\'s almost hatred of Africans is everywhere apparent, this, which would, no doubt, have been ""worn-out declamation"" from us, may possibly be considered worthy of credit.\n\nThe F.R.G.S. carries about with him everywhere ""a consul,"" as closely attached to and as inseparable from him as were the Siamese twins to and from each other, so that we may be excused if we fail at times to distinguish between them.

He was a gentleman fond of his bed and also of his Madeiran wicker-work armchair. He read a little; but when excited, which was rare, he would declaim loudly against the practice of \'lecture,\' as worthless touching the main enjoyments of human life—eating, drinking, visiting friends, and attending the theatre. According to him, the summum bonum of human life was to lie upon his back smoking cigarettes and looking at the moon or at all the stars. He once, but only once, gathered energy to sermon me upon the subject of over curiosity.

A glance by our friends and readers at our letters from Bathurst, published this month, will suffice, without further comment on the points that personally concern us, to show that we are no exception to this disagreeable rule. But our conscience is at ease. Why should we have troubled ourselves more about the Colonial Hospital at the Gambia than about that at Sierra Leone? The complaints made respecting it have not come from us, but from those to whom the institution belongs, since that the salary of the medical officer and the expenses of the hospital are paid, not out of British, but out of the colonial revenue. We do not know, we never saw, we are utter personal strangers to the Colonial Surgeon; we never had any transactions direct or indirect with him out of which any antagonism or ill-feeling could on our part arise. Why, then, should we animadvert especially on the management of the institution under his charge, and thus by implication, as well as directly, on himself? We have no personal end to serve. The management of this journal has never brought us any pecuniary advantages, and has entailed upon us nothing but labour and anxiety. We are continually under the weight of a sense of duty to the African people whose cause we have undertaken to promote and to defend. Before the establishment of this journal they had no safety-valve for their discontents as they now have, no available means of making their just complaints and their grievances known to the Government and to their friends in this country; and in the discharge of our duty we have always endeavoured to proceed with caution and moderation. As we have before stated, and now repeat, our aim has been to bring about a removal of abuses, and the carrying out of necessary reforms with the least possible injury to the feelings of those who had upheld or profited by the former, and were not unnaturally inclined to impede and prevent the latter. Men who may have lived in an atmosphere of corrupt administration and of great laxity of official principle, often fancy that they have a vested interest in abuses which they may have themselves inaugurated or succeeded to in practice, and become exceedingly sore at all interference with them. If there be any of our readers, official or unofficial, who may not hitherto have been convinced of the absolute necessity of our interference as regards the colonial medical department at the Gambia, we refer them to the letter of “Observer” in our present number. We gave a list some months ago of the many lucrative offices accumulated in the hands of the Colonial Surgeon, the whole of which it would seem impossible for him properly to discharge, while enjoying an almost entire monopoly of the medical duties and practice of the colony. But what will our readers now think of the superior authority which appoints to the office of coroner a person who is at the head of the Colonial Hospital as surgeon, who in the same capacity is responsible for the health of the inmates of the jail infirmary, and who, from his position, and the absence of competition, monopolises the lucrative general medical practice in the colony? And what, again, will they think of the person who accepts these incompatible duties? “Observer’s” letter goes so straight and so clearly to the point as regards this great abuse that very little comment is necessary on our part, the impropriety, to say the least, of a medical officer having to sit as coroner to inquire into the cause of death in persons who may have been under medical treatment by him being, we imagine, too flagrant for any man to deny. Are we wrong in calling the attention of the Colonial-office to abuses of so very serious a nature; or are the colonists, black or white, wrong in stirring us up to action in a matter in which they are themselves powerless to obtain redress? Our experience, alas! has taught us that the only corrective in these cases is to bring public opinion to bear upon Governors and Secretaries of State. The former had enjoyed on the West Coast of Africa, until our advent, a long impunity of misrule; the most flagrant jobs were perpetrated by men who, falling under pecuniary obligations to one or more influential persons in the colony, lost their independence, and became virtually compelled to execute the behests of their hard taskmasters.

The story was one of claims for 5,000 dollars against one of the principal chiefs, put forward some twenty years ago by a Mr. Williams who was the United States Consular agent there. In course of time the United States Government sent a ship of war to visit the group and inquire into the claims preferred. The officer commanding acted a very strange and discreditable part, in direct violation of his instructions, which enjoined a close investigation and strict impartiality, neither of which was in any way observed. The result of his proceedings added 13,000 dollars to Mr. Williams\' original claim without any show of reason; and when the business issued from his hands the total amount charged against the unfortunate chief was 45,000 dollars! The hopeless wretchedness of the poor chief under this enormous pressure unjustly put upon him by United States officials was mainly drawn by the writer in *Blackwood*; and when the magazine reached America last July, the Government of the United States did not think it beneath their dignity to make fresh inquiries into the matter. A vessel of war was dispatched. On her arrival at Fiji a court of arbitration was formed; the commander produced his brief, *which was the extract from Blackwood*, and, after two day\'s investigation, decided that 13,000 dollars of Mr. Williams\'s claim must be disallowed, as there was not a shadow of any evidence whatever to sustain it. The finding of the court spoke of their award as doing ""tardy justice to a semi-barbarous and almost helpless chief, over whose head these claims had been held for twenty years, and who is now struggling to raise himself and his people from the depths of heathenism to the light of civilization.""

This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me. But I hope my experience will be of some use to others who, trading on the West Coast of Africa, are under the necessity of trusting so much to persons or firms in London or the other European capitals.—Yours faithfully,', 'last_edit_date': '1891-06-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_06_1891#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.641, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}]",True

An examination of the political treaties suggests the conclusion that some of them were legally indefensible, some morally bank› rupt, while others were procured legally. Nevertheless, they were essentially political acts defensible only in the context of European positive law which saw force as the basis of all law. Even where Africans openly sought treaty arrangements with Europeans, their decisions were invariably based on their perceptions of European strength.

There were also numerous instances in which the Africans and the Europeans disagreed on the interpretation of the arrangements between them.

This was largely because the new European trade was an outgrowth of the prenineteenth-century slave trade. The legitimate trade was pioneered by former slave-traders and often even by practising slave-traders. It is import› ant to emphasize this because the structure of the new trade was very similar to that of the old. There was to be an increasing monetization of the trade in the latter part of the century but, in the first half, the trade in palm oil, groundnuts (peanuts), ivory and cloves depended on the internal slave trade and the trust system: that is, the advance of trade goods on credit to the bigger African traders, thus necessitating measures to protect the investment and to guarantee delivery of goods. As long as European traders remained on the coast and African traders brought goods to them there, or coastal African middlemen took goods on credit to the interior to negotiate for and bring produce back to the coast, or pombeiros and Arab and Swahili traders did the same, the new trade was conducted within the existing pre-nineteenth-century structure. More Africans were involved in the collection of palm fruits, gum arabic, honey, and even ivory than had been in the procurement and sale of slaves to Europeans. Increasingly, also, in the major trading areas on the coast and along the trade routes, there were subtle changes in the composition and method of recruiting the political elite among the African populations. Notably, events of the nineteenth century favoured the rise to prominence of warrior groups seeking to share political power. Some of the creóles also became substantial traders and their numbers and importance were to increase into the 1870s. But the rapidity and the extent of social mobility should not be exaggerated. The traditional rulers and chiefs did not easily surrender their privileges. Rather, wherever possible, they brought in a few warriors to strengthen their position, and occasionally relied on the odd European or creóle traders. The warrior or creóle merchant seeking a share in chiefly privileges had to compete for it within the existing structures. They recruited a large following of slaves and clients, acquired wealth and tried to use it to buy their way into positions of influence and power. Thus, the diversification of the items of trade without : substantial modification of the pattern of trade did not produce the economic and social revolution expected, at least not in the first half of the', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'New trends and processes in Africa in the nineteenth century', 'section_title': 'New economic trends', 'content': 'In the economic as in the other fields, some new trends became discernible during our period. The most radical change was the well-known one of the abolition and suppression of the slave trade and its replacement by export agriculture which has wrongly, but in a typically Eurocentric manner, been termed legitimate trade. Radical in its impact as it was, this change was rather slow in coming. Indeed, in East and Central Africa, as will be seen below, the first six decades of the century saw the expansion and intensification of that inhuman traffic.$^{61}$ It was not until the very end of the period under review that export agriculture completely replaced the slave trade.\nVery well-known as this change was, its real significance has been lost on many scholars. It was not the change-over from the so-called illegitimate to the so-called legitimate trade but, rather, the fundamental shift in the distribution of incomes from the ruling aristocratic elite to the ordinary people that was significant. Since the slave trade, which constituted the principal source of income, was a monopoly of the kings and their military leaders and advisers, the bulk of the income went to them. But with its replacement by natural products such as palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, gum, honey, beeswax, kola nuts, etc., which could be produced or collected by the ordinary people, and especially those living in the rural areas, a steady redistribution of income ensued, leading to the rise of a new set of rich people in not only the urban and market centres but also in the rural areas. The roots of the present-day phenomenon of rural capitalism can be traced to this period.\nAnother consequence of the development of this export agriculture was the steady integration into the capitalist world-economy not only of the external economy of Africa, but also its internal or rural economy. Unfor› tunately, nowhere in Africa was this fundamental change in the mode of production accompanied by a corresponding change in the means of production. In other words, the change to export agriculture was not accompanied by a technological change in the means of production nor in the industrial processing of the products prior to exportation. Africa was therefore unable during the period to develop an economy that could stand up against the capitalist and industrialized economy of Europe, hence the tragedy that befell it in the following decades.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.623, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': ""Many European historians have condemned the opposers as being romantic and short-sighted and have praised the so-called collaborators as being far-sighted and progressive. As Oliver and Fage put it in 1962: If these [African rulers] were far-sighted and well-informed, and more particularly if they had had access to foreign advisers such as mission› aries or traders they might well understand that nothing was to be gained by resistance, and much by negotiation. If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ... As with the slave trade in earlier times, there were gainers as well as losers, and both were to be found within the confines of every colonial territory. ls Ronald E. Robinson and John Gallagher have also described opposition or resistance as consisting of 'romantic reactionary struggles against the facts, the passionate protests of societies which were shocked by the new age of change and would not be comforted'.$^{16}$ But these views are highly questionable and the dichotomy between resisters and so-called collabor› ators is not only mechanistic but simply unconvincing.

Rotberg and Ali A.

Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The abolition of the slave trade', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""This chapter does not attempt to assess the magnitude of each of the changes that the nineteenth century brought to Africa. It makes no claim to be a survey of the entire slave-trade phenomenon and, for instance, refers only in passing to the trans-Saharan and the Arab trade, which merit analysis by specialists in those fields. It outlines in broad terms the difficulties encountered by the Western world in abolishing the trade in black slaves, mostly bound for plantations on the American side of the Atlantic, and briefly sets out the circumstances under which the trade came virtually to an end, indicating some of the consequences that this entailed. A great deal of research is still needed in order to obtain a clearer view of the whole phenomenon, and emphasis should be laid on the study of oral tradition as being the main source of information.\nAfrican participation in the trade had never been general. Some of the hinterland peoples were quite unaware of it. Some coastal societies destroyed slave ships and held their crews to ransom. Others had their political and class structure overturned by it. Others again drew strength from the authoritarian and exclusivist nature of the system, and in those cases black and white interests coincided in a flourishing business. Some African producers and distributors of exportable manpower did well out of this branch of the coastal economy and foreign trade. During the eighteenth century they bartered nearly 7 million human beings for approximately 300 million piastres-worth of merchandise specific to the 'Guinea trade', including perhaps 80 million firearms. In the same period, the trans-Saharan trade accounted for the deportation of over 700000 individuals and the Indian Ocean trade for about 200 000. At the end of the Middle Passage the slave-traders exchanged the 6 million Africans who had survived the voyage - 40 per cent of them women and children against the produce of slave labour, which sold increasingly well on the European side of the Atlantic. Nevertheless some European intellectuals, their principles and finer feelings outraged, condemned the eating of sugar dyed with the blood of the 'forgotten men of the universe', and called for the abolition of the trade."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.618, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the world-economy', 'section_title': ""From 'luxury' to 'essential' trading patterns"", 'content': ""It is clear that, at some point, the slave-dealers were no longer 'foraging' for persons to be enslaved but had begun to be engaged in systematic It should also be noted that the total curve for Africa masks a geographic shift.

Their learned observation endorses the popular view. But the proposition needs explanation. Humanitarianism is a Western ideology, and it is unlikely to have found any place in the minds of African distributors of the time - with very rare exceptions. But this does not mean that they were constitutionally incapable of giving up the trade, as Western supporters of slavery maintained. The continuance of the supply of exportable manpower from Africa can be logically explained in economic terms. That the distributors were black and the exporters white is irrelevant: it was a paying proposition, profitable to both trading partners, whose sole object was to make money. That was the situation at the grass roots. The continuance of the supply is to be explained in terms of the efficient working of an integrated system: and what Africans were resisting was the disruption of this system. For one thing, it would have ruined the established business of the distributors,$^{31}$ who had no other prospects, to say nothing of the chain of repercussions it would have set off on the social and political structure, both locally and further afield. In other words, so long as the barter system between the hinterland and the coast, and the coast's foreign trade, had no clear alternative to the slave trade, opposition by African slave-traders to its suppression was dictated strictly by the imperative needs to avoid commercial chaos.$^{32}$ The supposed complicity of the African distributors was no more than a reflex reaction to the immediate economic situation. This also explains the fall in the selling price of exportable manpower: it was the market's defence against growing pressure from the forces of suppression. The latter thus helped to contribute to an unsatisfactory situation. This argument needs to be modi› fied when the exportation of Africans to the north or east is considered. While the economic interests of the slave hunters and distributors are selfevident in this case too, it is hard to see what kind of economic compensa› tion accrued to the countries that were plundered.

Indeed, Africans had been present in Western Europe from Classical Antiquity onwards, though the numbers only became substantial from about the fifteenth century on, when black Africans, first as slaves and then as freedmen, began to appear in southern Spain and Portugal, arriving at first by way of the trans-Saharan trade to North Africa. Then, as the direct maritime trade from Europe began to open in the second half of the century, still larger numbers of Africans appeared in Europe. 30 Many were slaves at first, especially in Portugal, the only significant slave-trading European power till nearly the middle of the seventeenth century. Over time, however, many found their way into the broader European society, though often at the bottom of the social hierarchy, since their social condition was assimilated to that of their fellow Africans who did most of the physical labour in the tropical colonies. Their legal status was also ambiguous. The law, in northern Europe generally, no longer recognized the status of slave, though European colonial laws did. From 1685, residence in France was held to confer freedom, and the same was true of England after the notable judicial decision of Lord Mansfield in 1772 already noted. In both situations, however, slaves from the colonies were still slaves de facto; in many instances until the European powers abolished slavery in the colonies themselves, in 1834 for Britain, 1848 for France, and 1888 for Brazil.\nIn spite of their ambiguous legal status, free Africans were present in Western Europe in considerable numbers from at least the mid-eighteenth century on. Estimates vary, but by 1800 they would have numbered several thousand in each of Spain, Portugal, France, or Britain; and in Spain or Portugal they would have been more numerous in an earlier period. The numbers were small in any case, compared with total European populations, but the African immigrants tended to be concentrated in the main cities, particularly in the port towns, so that their presence was more visible than their numbers would suggest.$^{31}$ It goes without saying that, for any period before the 1840s, far more people of tropical African descent would have been found in Europe than Europeans in tropical Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.635, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The diaspora in Europe', 'content': 'This community of Africans in Europe was also concentrated in certain occupations, especially domestic service, this being partly a carry-over from the occupational status of Africans who came by way of West Indian slavery, partly a reflection of the European fad for exotic servants. African sailors were also common by this time in the merchant service, though more so in Portugal than in France or Britain. Another significant, if smaller, group was made up of students, who began to arrive in Europe in significant numbers by the middle of the eighteenth century and, in increasing numbers, throughout the nineteenth century. In an era in which commercial contact between Europe and Africa was increasing, it was an obvious advantage to African traders to be literate in a Western language and to have some acquaintance with European accounting practices. Many of these students therefore came to Europe through the good offices of European slave-traders operating in Africa and studied under their care in the principal slave-trade ports like Liverpool or Nantes.\nStill another peculiarity of the African communities in Europe was the fact that they were overwhelmingly male. This fact had two important implications. The African community was not self-sustaining. It had to be, and was, constantly replenished from overseas. This is not to say that the Africans had no sexual relations with European women, but the products of these relationships tended to be culturally European rather than African. After a few generations, the African physical appearance tended to disappear into the general European genetic pool.\nSome Africans also found their way into Eastern Europe, in spite of a more attenuated maritime contact with tropical Africa itself.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

Well, if compensating the slave-holders meant atonement, then they might rest in peace. But where, he asked, was the compensation to Africa for the frightful legacy of crime and degradation they had left behind? Where was the reparation and atonement for the millions torn from their homes and the millions massacred, for a land laid waste, for the further warping of the rudimentary moral ideas of myriads of people, and the driving of them into ten-fold lower depths of savagery than they had known before the European era? For answer it would no doubt be said that ""legitimate commerce"" had replaced the vile traffic in human flesh and blood. Still the same old story—legitimate commerce—magic words which gave such a glamour to whatever could creep under their shelter—words which had too often blinded a gullible public to the most shameful and the most criminal transactions. They would perhaps tell him that every trading station, once the slave traffic was stopped, became the handmaiden of Christianity and civilisation, a beacon of light and leading, before which barbarism was bound to disappear. That was what he once thought the rôle which the trading stations was enacting in the dark depths of Africa, but over the greater part of the Continent it was not so at present, and had not been so in the past. He was there that night to speak the truth as it appeared to him, and it was this—that, taken as a whole, their trading stations on the greater part of the West Coast of Africa, instead of being centres of beneficent and elevating influences, had been in the past disease-breeding spots which had infected with a blighting and demoralising poison the whole country around. They had been centres of corruption, where men had coined money out of the moral and physical ruin of the tribes they supplied. This had been the result of the legitimate commerce that was to benefit the negro. What did they think had been the character of this so-called legitimate commerce? It consisted to an enormous extent of vile spirits and weapons of destruction—the one, to ruin the buyers; the other to enable them to slaughter their neighbours.\n\nThe lecturer went on to refer to the results of the gin traffic, which, he said, only received a more powerful stimulus with the stoppage of the slave trade.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence.

I said to some of them: \'You are spending millions of money on a line in which it must be wasted. Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty. The enterprises in East Africa, both of Englishmen and Germans, are only commercial movements, not colonisation, and are not only liable to but will share the fate which has befallen all great European, secular or religious, movements in equatorial Africa. You rightly consider that the agents in the work of Africa\'s regeneration are the civilised and Christianised negroes now in exile. Mahometanism, notwithstanding the sneers of some and the ignorance of others, is doing a wonderful work in Africa, really preserving the people against the unscrupulous proceedings of European traders and adventurers. The Arabs can do no harm, they as readily follow as lead in negro land. Jesus Christ as a religious reformer and as a regenerator of all the races of mankind was right. These organisations, which undertake to represent Him among foreign races, have not yet half understood Him, and He will not endorse work which not only contravenes the spirit but the letter of his teachings.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

More than 100 years ago the ships of one or two Liverpool and Bristol merchants were actively engaged in exchanging cargo for slaves, ivory, and palm oil. Fifty years ago the four or five leading houses in the trade were already strong enough to dispense with the profits of slave traffic and rely on the ordinary channels of commerce. It was not, however, without great sacrifices and outlay of money on their part that the change was made palatable to the great native chiefs of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, who had grown immensely wealthy and powerful by the trade in humanity. To induce a better business in native products, loans and presents of cotton goods, hardware, and other articles were made on an extensive scale, and the palm oil trade thus rapidly developed in importance. Examination of the shipping books of one of the greatest firms of that period (1843) shows about forty-six various assortments of articles shipped in twelve months; and the changes brought about by improving civilisation and persistent commercial effort are evidenced in the 300 or more distinct and separate items of export now found in the invoice books of Oil Rivers merchants. Comparative statistics are not available in any authentic form. The quantity of palm oil imported into Europe has varied very little all along, though the tendency has been slightly to increase. A new trade, however, rivalling in dimensions that in oil, has sprung up through the activity of English merchants, and palm kernels—formerly waste product—are bought up in great quantities for shipment to European crushing mills.

This trade, once inaugurated, was carried on by the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans down to the end of the last century, when the revival of human feeling urged certain philanthropists in England to move towards the abolition of a great evil. But during all this period the negro himself was as much to blame as the white and yellow men; indeed, it was probable that negroes were enslaving negroes long before Egyptian or Arab bought black servants from the negro chiefs, and at the present day there would be no slavery in Africa if an approval of slavery were not present in the philosophy of the negro tribes of Africa. Slavery and the slave trade, with the tribal wars and their attendant insecurity, had been the cause of Africa's backward condition, and if ever that Continent were to be raised to the civilisation of Europe, slavery and the slave trade must be extirpated. The two great slave markets which, until a few years ago, had existed in America, and in Turkey and Persia rendered the inducements to slave traders so great that the guarding of the coasts of Africa by British cruisers only checked the trade in a very slight degree; and even now many slaves were sent to Arabia, Persia, and Madagascar. In the present day, however, Africa was the main consumer of its own slaves. The most remarkable revival of the slave trade and occurred in German East Africa. The Germans, under Major Von Wissmann, began by suppressing a revolt of the Arab slave dealers, which led to the almost complete extinction of the oversea slave traffic on the German coast of East Africa; but the organisation of a strong government led to the rapid settling down of the Arabs as great landed proprietors, with an unlimited number of slaves to work their plantations. Legally slavery could not exist in German territory, but in such a wide and sparsely populated region it was impossible to prevent it in fact; and as the slaves were ordinarily well and kindly treated, it never occurred to them to want to leave their masters or to better their condition. It might be asked where, then, was the harm of slavery? The harm lay in this, that slavery commenced with an initial evil. The speaker then drew a picture of the loss of life, devastation of countries, and breaking of family ties which attended a capture of slaves. This depopulation of whole regions was attended with another evil, the return of the dreaded tsetse fly; and the surest way of extirpating this pest was to encourage population in the fertile districts of Central Africa.

They made such a plausible tale that I was quite taken with them, and forwarded a box of gold dust, together with samples of goods I wanted in return. This came duly into their hands, and I received an acknowledgment from them with a statement showing that the gold dust had realised £56 10s. 10d., but that the goods I required would cost a good deal more than that. I accordingly obtained and forwarded to them a draft, making in all £97 10s. 2d.; at the same time sending them my gold watch (value £7) for cleaning and repairs in London. This second remittance was also acknowledged in due course—and there the matter ended! Finding weeks go by, and nothing come to hand, I wrote to a firm in London, upon whose integrity I can rely, for them to inquire into the matter, and do the best they could—either in the way of getting back my money or by urging these people to hurry on with the goods, so that I might not entirely lose the market. They accordingly wrote to the firm in question several times, but only to receive vague promises of immediate attention, or still more evasive answers. So I determined myself to come to London to see what could be done. And the upshot of my inquiries is that the firm to whom I had consigned my money and goods have proved utter swindlers: they traded under a fancy name, and when they found things were getting too hot for them they left the country, so as to be beyond the reach of the law.\n\nFor myself I must make up my mind to cut my loss; as I understand that even if I could get hold of the swindlers there is no chance of my regaining any portion of what they have had from me.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.725, 'probability_score': 0.053, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.657, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance. They claimed that it was often the result of 'superstition' and that peoples otherwise content to accept colonial rule had been worked upon by 'witch-doctors'. Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa.

This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories.

Equally guilty of overstatement are those colonial apologists, such as Gann, Duignan and Lloyd who see colonialism as an unqualified blessing for Africa as well as those like Perham and Fieldhouse who see the record as a balanced one. A more accurate judgement in this writer's opinion is not that colonialism did not do anything positive for Africa, it indeed did. But Europeans did make huge profits in Africa through mining companies, trading houses, banks, shipping lines, plantations and concession companies. Moreover governments held substantial foreign reserves from the colonies in metropolitan countries which must have provided some of the capital for metropolitan development. Finally, metro› politan industries benefited from cheap raw materials obtained from the colonies and profits made from the export of manufactured goods. When all this is compared with what the African owners of the land, peasant agriculturalists and mine labourers obtained, and the fact that whatever infrastructural and social facilities that were provided had to be paid for by the colonies themselves, one cannot but marvel at the raw deal which colonialism thrust on Africans. Moreover, whatever colonialism did for Africans in Africa, given its opportunities, its resources and the power and influence it wielded in Africa at the time, it could and should have done far more than it did. As even Lloyd admits: 'So much more might perhaps have been done had the development of backward territories been seen by the industrial nations as a first priority'.$^{49}$ It is precisely because colonial rulers not only did not see the development of Africans as their first priority, but did not see it as a priority at all that they stand condemned.

One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage. The indigenous elites have patronized change as a way of getting Africa on to her feet and making her states equal members of the community of nations."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.652, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'A second serious social legacy has been the European and Asiatic settler problem.

For the ruling classes, traditional or created, it brought a new strength and security of status and new forms of wealth and power. For many years after annexation, though there was much bewilderment, revolts were very few, and there does not appear to have been much sense of indignity at being ruled.

In their A Short History of Africa which first appeared in 1962, one of the very first modern professional surveys of the history of Africa, the English historians, Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage, devoted only a single paragraph to what they termed 'bitter resistance' by Africans in a chapter of fourteen pages dealing with what has become known as the European Scramble for African colonies.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

The plaintiff began to sue for forgiveness—though he had done nothing amiss—but this hard-hearted defendant refused to grant it, and left the boat, with orders that the plaintiff should not be allowed to re-enter, and went to the town in company with his wife. The plaintiff, relying on the feelings of the defendant, went into the boat during his absence, not being willing to be left at so great a distance from his home at so late a time of the day, it being between five and six o'clock p.m. But the plaintiff mistook his man. The defendant, finding the plaintiff in it, ordered him out; and when the plaintiff urged that he knew no one at Goderich, and showed reluctance to quit, the defendant told the men to put him out by force, and, as is alleged, gave his own assistance to effect this purpose, and even struck the plaintiff with his umbrella. I do not question the truth or falsity of the latter statement; one thing for certain I do know, that the defendant, according to his own evidence, committed a gross assault on the plaintiff; for Mr. Goldsworthy tells us that he took hold of the man by the collar of his jumper, and, having tightened his grasp, flung him away from the boat into the water. Here was a pitiful advantage for a high official to take of his African subordinate! Talk about the semi-barbarism of the Africans! Let those who delight in the use of the term look to Jamaica for a Ramsey, a Cullen, and others; and to Africa for a Goldsworthy, Inspector-General of Police. Not one of these is an African; they were all born in Europe, which boasts of high civilisation, yet we find them all acting in a manner which would put to the blush the veriest savage. These are the men sent among Africans as examples to copy. Mr. Goldsworthy, the defendant, stated that drunkenness was the main cause for his putting the defendant out of the boat, but I cannot readily believe this; for if it be true, then the question obviously arises, Why was not Wright likewise put out, who was equally drunk? Why was Shepherd made the object of his spite? Why was he left to sleep on the beach in the open air with wet clothes and without food, and Wright brought back in the boat to Freetown? The answer is easy. The plaintiff had complained of being hungry; he told the defendant so; and as this despot objected to the men speaking to him, this step of the plaintiff wounded his pride; added to which, the plaintiff, on being told to take in his oar, _looked_ at the defendant, which look was taken for insolence. All these it seems as if he were determined to resent; we see how the thing was rankling in his breast all the way, from the course he adopted with the plaintiff immediately on reaching Goderich, by telling him to desist giving his help in pulling up the boat. This seems to have been the mainspring which actuated Mr. Goldsworthy in his brutality to the man Shepherd. The plaintiff very justly refused to leave the boat which had brought him eight or nine miles from home, to a place where he knew no one; and if the defendant is right in what he did, then any captain of a vessel would be justified, under similar circumstances, to put any one or more of his crew ashore, unprovided for, in any place he pleases. Mr. Goldsworthy ought to have brought the man home, or if he could not do so with safety to himself, he was bound to provide him with food and a lodging. Suppose the man had died on the beach that night, what then? Would this defendant have been responsible or not? We have not only to do with what has really taken place, but also with what might have taken place. It is good for the defendant that so sad an occurrence did not take place, for then he would have found himself in the dock arraigned on the charge, if not of murder, at least of manslaughter. This whole transaction shows him to be unfit to hold his position; he is a hard-hearted and cruel man, with the feelings of pity completely crushed out of his soul. What is the use of keeping such a man in authority, unless it be to encourage the free use of his propensities for cruelty? Not satisfied to have the Government boat and men to pull him about on pleasure excursions, he must illtreat them too, by way of compensation for their services; because they are so many beasts of burden to be beaten and kicked about at his will. These things cannot be any longer tolerated in the country, and the sooner a stop be put to them the better for all concerned.""}, {'id': 4662, 'article_title': 'Gambia—Bathurst, River Gambia—Liberia—West African Gold Fields—Affairs in Ashanti—Wreck and Plunder of a Ship at Grand Popo', 'full_section_title': 'Gambia—Bathurst, River Gambia—Liberia—West African Gold Fields—Affairs in Ashanti—Wreck and Plunder of a Ship at Grand Popo', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1883#article-1', 'issue_date': '01_08_1883', 'content': ""Dear Sir,—When will some natives of this country be persuaded to see their folly in plundering vessels?

It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries.

Europeans cannot do the work which you desire to do in Africa—if your desire is to open up the country and regenerate the people—by the methods at present pursued. You have had for nigh 300 years the unrequited labour of the African in the Western hemisphere, and it may be that all the money you have made through his labour will have to be spent in connexion with his country before anything will be done of permanent utility; but it is a pity that the money, of which you seem to have an unlimited supply, should not be spent in a manner to yield better results.\'""\n\nThe writer continues:—\n\n""To talk of Europeans colonising intertropical Africa is the greatest piece of folly that men with the experience of past generations and the present before them could be guilty.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished.

The result has been unspeakably disappointing. Leaving out of consideration the towns of Sierra Leone and Lagos, where the conditions have been abnormal, the tendency has been everywhere in the line of deterioration. There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast. To a man, the Kru-boys have spent years in contact with such ameliorating influences as are to be found in those parts, yet their tastes have risen no higher than a desire for gin, tobacco, and gunpowder. These they get in return for a few months\' or a year\'s labour, to go back home and for a few short days enjoy a fiendish holiday.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.648, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.678, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The state of African preparedness', 'content': 'Above all, following the abolition of the hideous and inhuman traffic in slaves, the Africans had been able to change over to an economy based on the exportation of cash crops - palm oil in Nigeria, groundnuts in Senegal and The Gambia - all before 1880 and cocoa had just been re› introduced into the Gold Coast by Tetteh Quashie from Fernando Po in 1879. And all this had occurred without the establishment of any direct European rule except in small pockets on the coast. Indeed, the relatively small group of West Africans who had benefited from European-style education were-by 1880 - doing extremely well. They were dominating the few civil service posts offered by European administrations; on the coast, some of them were running their own import-export businesses and were monopolizing the internal distribution of imported goods. It was in East Africa that European influences were still minimal, although after the epoch-making journeys of Livingstone and Stanley and the subsequent propaganda by missionary societies, it was only a matter of time before churches and schools, and with them roads and railways, would make their appearance.\nAs far as Africans were concerned, then, they did not see any need for any radical change in their centuries-old relations with Europe, and they were confident that if the Europeans wanted to force any changes on them and push their way inland, they would be able to stop them as they had been able to do for the last two or three hundred years.

This is a question that has so far not been seriously considered by historians, African or European, but it needs to be answered. The answer is quite clear and unequivocal: an overwhelming majority of African authorities and leaders were vehemently opposed to this change and expressed their determination to maintain the status quo and, above all, to retain their sovereignty and independence, an issue on which virtually all of them were not in any way prepared to compromise. This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men. I do not write this in a boastful spirit but in the clear sense of its meaning ... the cause of Asante is progressing and there is no reason for any Asante man to feel alarm at the prospects or to believe for a single instant that our cause has been driven back by the events of the past hostilities. 2\nIn 1895, Wobogo, the Moro Naba, or King of the Mossi (in modern Upper Volta), told the French officer, Captain Destenave: I know that the whites wish to kill me in order to take my country, and yet you claim that they will help me to organize my country. But I find my country good just as it is. I have no need of them. I know what is necessary for me and what I want: I have my own merchants: also, consider yourself fortunate that I do not order your head to be cut off.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

As a result the Allied powers had to divert scarce military resources, needed for fighting the Germans in Africa as well as on the Western Front, to dealing with local revolts. So scarce were these resources, and so widespread the revolts in certain areas such as French West Africa and Libya that the reimposition of European control over the revolted areas had to be delayed until troops became available. Large areas of Haut-SØnØgal-Niger and Dahomey remained out of French control for as long as a year for lack of troops. Thus the French were initially unable to deal with the revolt of 1916 in Dahomeyan Borgu because neighbouring groups - the Somba of Atacora, the Pila Pila of Semere and the Ohori among others - were also in revolt. In Morocco Lyautey, its conquistador, feared that metropolitan instructions to return half his 70000 troops to France and withdraw to the Atlantic coast might lead to revolt. Though he had to release the men, he did not withdraw and managed to avert challenge to his authority. As it was, France had to keep the other 35 000 troops in Morocco throughout the war. In Portuguese East Africa the German invasion inspired Portuguese subjects to take the occasion to overthrow their hated overlords. 31 The causes of the widespread revolts and protest movements that took place during the war varied considerably and were not all directly connected with the war itself. In some cases what were described as revolts were, in effect, as in Libya, just the continuation of primary resistance to European occupation. In many cases the motives for revolt or protest were mixed. There can be no doubt that the visual evidence of the apparent weakening of European authority as represented by the exodus of Euro› peans encouraged those contemplating revolt just as the influx of Europeans, in particular British troops, discouraged it in Egypt.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'African initiatives and resistance in the face of partition and conquest', 'section_title': 'The ideology of resistance', 'content': ""Colonial apologists stressed the irrationality and desperation of armed resistance.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history. To be colonised is to be removed from history ...

The period after 1910 was essentially one of consolidation and exploitation of the system. The pace of this drama was truly astonishing, for as late as 1880 only very limited areas of Africa had come under the direct rule of Europeans. In the whole of West Africa, only the island and coastal areas of Senegal, the town of Freetown and its environs (now in Sierra Leone), the southern parts of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the coastal areas of Abidjan in Ivory Coast and Porto Novo in Dahomey (now Benin) and the island of Lagos (in what is now Nigeria) had come under the direct rule of Europeans.

The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible.

Ever since he had, thinking of Livingstone's friendly manner, and the intense earnestness of his language, entertained a high opinion of missionaries. The real work of the missionary was very hard indeed—(hear, hear)—and where lay their reward? How could it possibly pay? The missionary had to teach himself, beginning with the very alphabet, and his education must occupy from six to ten years. Meanwhile, what did the home society give to encourage and cheer him in his task? A few sodden bananas, a pound or two of beans, and a few ears of rice. He was thought to be treated in a princely way if he got a little flour. There was no wine, no whisky, no champagne. (Laughter.) He must drink Congo water, tea, coffee, and cocoa, if the society liked, and that was all. He had with that treatment to think of the society kindly. But if they reflected on what their own thoughts would be of any one who had given them fever, they might realize how unbounded was a missionary's charity to be able constantly to think of his work and of his society kindly. (Laughter, and hear, hear.) It was only after the missionary had educated himself by long years of patient industry that he could hope to convert the natives around him, or even to impress them with a kindly feeling. Then he began the story of hope, the story of his own country and of those who had sent him out. He thought he could write an interesting book of the true story of missionary life in Africa, for he was unprejudiced and unbiased, and though some people thought the contrary, he did not exaggerate. When a missionary had got initiated into native ways, and had learned the language of the tribe sufficiently to be able to benefit, he heard perhaps of another tribe, higher up, of more promising character, and then, if he went to them, he had to go through the same process of studying the new language and trying to obtain the same power over the natives by convincing them of his kindly motives and intentions. Otherwise it was hopeless to expect to implant any interest in black men. He had given them the merest outlines of a picture, of which they could fill in the details themselves, and then they would be able to imagine one of their missionaries at his work in Africa. Touching, then, upon the country, he said that the part about the Congo might not inaptly be thought of as a vast botanical garden or conservatory, but instead of a glass dome there was a burning sky, with a white sun shining through it at a temperature between 80 deg. and 100 deg. For encountering the perils of such a country he feared the society did not inquire of their young missionaries how much judgment, discretion, and good sense they had, though a man ought to be blessed with abundance of good sense to know how to live in the Congo country. They had a solemn duty before them to the young men they were about to send out to the Congo or to Africa, without teaching them how to live wisely, and that duty was as manifest on the society as if it were the young men were their own children to whom they wished long life, for a dead missionary six feet under ground was of no more value than any other dead man. (Hear, hear.) What was the value of dead Gordon on the Nile? Absolutely nothing; but had he lived, the civilization that had received its death-blow in the Soudan would still be in its spring, and they would not have had long to wait to see summer dawning in the interior of Africa. (Cheers.) He would suggest to the society what he had impressed upon the Committee at Brussels—that they should prepare some practical precepts for the every-day conduct of young men going out to Africa. The problem was how, on the breezy mountains and in the deep valleys, with tall grasses waving before the eternal South Atlantic wind, he could preserve himself in health and strength to carry out the work for which he was sent. The great danger to which a novice in Africa was exposed was getting chills from the ever-prevalent South Atlantic wind when bathed in perspiration, by sitting in the coolest spots he could find, bathing in every stream he came across, and drinking immoderately of its water. It was the commonest thing for young men making their way from the mouth of the Congo on first landing to Stanley Pool to over exert themselves, by doing the distance in fourteen or fifteen days, committing all these errors on the way. If they were sufficiently strong to escape without an immediate attack of fever, and to arrive in apparent health, they were attacked when reaction set in, and probably paid the penalty of imprudence with their death. With this state of things he contrasted the spectacle of Livingstone living to his 61st year in the interior of Africa without medicines or stores, living on corn cobs and bananas, and up to the last talking with enthusiasm of the beauties of Africa. In reality, with prudence and the exercise of common sense, the climate of Africa was not half as dangerous as many parts of the Southern United States. He could take that company to a place in the Southern States where they would not be twelve hours before all of them would be down with fever. (Laughter.) Yet at that very place the population since 1860 had doubled, and they would see plenty of beautiful women and children. If women and children could live there with care, what was to prevent the same thing in Africa? The same sort of foolish exposure which in New York carried off young people with pneumonia, knocked down people with fever in Africa; and in both cases it could be avoided by avoiding the sudden chill which did all the mischief. These were little practical details, which they ought to impress on the minds of the young missionaries whom they sent out to Africa. Acknowledging then the receipt of the handsome testimonial, which he explained would have to be consigned to packing cases, which contained sixty or seventy of the same sort, for which, pending his final settlement, he could find no place, he said that though he could not carry the testimonials themselves, he could and did carry the kindly feelings and sentiments by which they had been accompanied. All that he had done for the Baptist missionaries had been done with good-will on his part; but to be honest with them, it was not out of his spontaneous good-will alone, for it was equally in obedience to a command of his Majesty the King of the Belgians. (Applause.) Should he find himself again in a position to do any further service either to the Baptist or to any other missionary society, he should do it with a free heart, and with perfect impartiality to all those labourers whose toil he had seen to be more severe than any his own in the heart of Africa.

There is a wonderful continent with 15,000 miles of coast-line, and something over 13,000,000 square miles of superficies—nearly five times as large as Europe; and yet it remains torpid, inert, lifeless, simply because Europeans have a deadly horror of the climate.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them. These were strong statements, they would say, and required confirmation. If true, what could possibly have caused this frightful miscarriage of the noblest aspirations of a Christian people? The answer was simply the nature of their commerce with Africa in the past and present.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence.

They must not if they could, and they ought not even if they wanted. They had laid themselves under an overwhelming load of debt to the African that centuries of beneficial work could never repay, and it would be well if they heard less about high-sounding words, schemes for the suppression of the African slave trade, and more practicable proposals for the stoppage of their equally ruin-working commerce in spirits and weapons of destruction.

It is nearly as old as recorded  \nhistory. It has interested thinking men in Europe and Asia in  \nall ages. The imagination of the ancients peopled the interior  \nof that country with a race of beings shut out from and needing  \nno intercourse with the rest of mankind—lifted by their purity  \nand simplicity of character above the necessity of intercourse  \nwith other mortals. The Greeks especially had very high con-  \nceptions of the sanctity and spirituality of the interior Africans.  \nIndeed, the religion of some portion of Greece is supposed to  \nhave been introduced from Africa. But leaving the region of  \nmythology, we know that the three highest religions known to  \nmankind—if they had not their origin in Africa—were domiciled  \nthere in the days of their feeble beginnings, Judaism, Christianity,  \nand Mohammedanism.  \nA sacred mystery hung over that continent, and many were  \nthe aspirations of philosophers and poets for some definite  \nknowledge of what was beyond the narrow fringe they saw.\n\nThe mystery still remains. The problem continues unsolved. The conquering races of the world stand perplexed before the difficulties which beset their enterprise of reducing that continent to subjection. Europe has extended her conquests to Australia, New Zealand, and the Archipelagos of the Pacific. But, for hundreds of years, their ships have passed by those tempting regions, where ""Afric\'s sunny fountains roll down their golden sands,"" and have been able to acquire no extensive foothold in that country. The points actually occupied by white men in the equatorial regions of that continent may be represented on the map only by microscopic dots. The bulk of Central Africa is being rapidly subjected to Mohammedanism. That system is, knitting together the conquerors and the conquered into a harmonious whole; and unless Europe gets a thorough understanding of the situation, the gates of missionary enterprise will be closed.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

Neither Egyptian, Carthaginian, Persian, or Roman influence was allowed to establish itself on that continent. It would seem that no solution of the African problem was to come from alien sources. Africans were not to share the fate of other dark races who have come in contact with the European. Europe was diverted to the Western Hemisphere. The energies of that conquering race were spent in building up a home for themselves on this side. Africa followed in chains.\n\nThe Negro race was to be preserved for a special work in the future. It is probable that if foreign races had been allowed to enter their country they would have been destroyed. So they were brought over to be helpers in America and at the same time to be preserved. Slavery would seem to be a strange school in which to preserve a people; but God has a way of salting as well as purifying by fire. The Europeans found in America an aboriginal race unable to co-operate with them in the labours required for the construction of the new civilisation. The Indians would not work, and have suffered the consequences of that indisposition: they have passed away. To take their place as accessories in the work to be done, the African was brought, who could work and would work, and could endure the climatic conditions of a new southern country, which Europeans could not. If Europe brought the Negro, Africa furnished the hands for the work which has been achieved. But when the new continent was opened Africa was closed.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

But so long as demijohn follows demijohn of rum ... no reinforcements of missionaries and no homilies from professional philanthropists, on the blessing of European civilization will avail anything. 43 An ardent campaigner for Africa-oriented educational reforms, Grant, deeply influenced by Blyden, sought an educational system which had the university at its apex but only as an institution which was designed to provide research and teaching in fields related to Africa, as opposed to the 'conventional literary education which emphasized European culture and values'.

Many European critics of colonialism, sympathetic to African protest, nevertheless also accepted that Africans had little in their 'traditional' patterns of thought which helped them to come to an effective or practical response to attacks on their way of life. The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

For example, in the millennial penumbra surrounding the disastrous Xhosa cattle sacrifice of the mid-nineteenth century, Africans widely believed that traditional lands and property and relatives would be returned via black intervention from across the seas. Again in 1910, during the time of the formation of the Union of South Africa, newspaper accounts told of an African bishop named Msiqinya who claimed to be a messiah from black America. The theme was repeated in 1921 when Enoch Mjigima, a Garveyite and leader of a group calling itself the Black Israelites, established contact with the Afro-American Church of God and Saints of Christ during the Bulhoek rebellion and in the Wellington prophecy (see Chapter 27). Mjigima at the time had corresponded with Garvey and wished to set up a branch of the UNIA in South Africa.\nOne of two lurid, fictionalized versions of the Afro-American millennial theme in the early twentieth century was a novel called PrØster John (1910). Written by a white man, the novel portrayed an overseas-educated African clergyman leading an enormous revolt against the whites. It created an immediate sensation in Southern Africa. For some, it was the blueprint followed by Chilembwe in the Nyasaland Revolt five years later. A second novel entitled Bayete! appeared in 1923 and dramatized the prospect of Afro-American influences in Southern Africa, playing upon the fear of Afro-American influences held by South African whites.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.577, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The First World War and its consequences', 'section_title': 'The European exodus', 'content': ""From the African point of view, perhaps even more remarkable than the apparent exodus of Europeans was the spectacle of white people fighting each other, a thing they had never done during the colonial occupation.

It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F.

In order that our readers may have some idea of the difficulties in the way of journalism where evils and errors are to be exposed with a view to effect a salutary change, we may state briefly what then occurred. We expurgated the chief communication we had received, which was a long report of a criminal case brought before one of the Courts, and incidents in the trial. We did not name the Court, nor the presiding Judge, nor the parties concerned. But it was held by our publishers that there was sufficient to lead to identification; and that, therefore, as “the greater the truth the greater the libel,” they could not take the risk of allowing it to appear in our columns. We had no resource but to bow to the decision, and refrain from publishing it. As it was strongly confirmative of what we had stated in our leader above alluded to, we can scarcely say that we submitted with a good grace. And yet, considering the small amount of support received by us from the West Coast, where comparatively so few of our nominal subscribers think it necessary to pay for the African Times, we can have no doubt they were right in preventing us as well as themselves from incurring any risk of the expense of defending an action for libel. At the same time, we feel it to be quite impossible to submit to entire silence, and, without therefore stating any of the particulars that were considered objectionable, we will merely give a short description of the *modus operandi* observed in obtaining a verdict. “When this\n\nwitness for the defence stated a fact that was important for the prosecution, the solicitor for the defence winked to the interpreter (the gentleman setting as Judge knowing nothing of the language), who did not interpret it at all. The solicitor then winked to the Judge, who thereupon said, \'Court adjourned for half an hour!\' The jurors then marched respectively in pairs to partake of refreshments, with sparkling moselle, &c., prepared for them by the said solicitor. On the reappearance of all parties in Court, after a few words of badinage by the solicitor, there were also a few from the Judge, concluding with, \'But I do not mean that you should find these parties guilty!\' and the jury obediently acquitted them."" It may be said, perhaps, the jury were right. But if we could publish the whole case, it would be seen in a moment that they were wrong, and that this was well known to those who induced the jury to return such a verdict. After our last month\'s leader we do not think it necessary to make any further observations on the above, merely adding that we could wish the report of the case as we have it were in the hands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom, however, it does not belong to us to forward it.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-05-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_05_1882#article-10', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.59, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'THE FALSE STATEMENT OF THE DROWNING OF KROOMEN FROM THE AFRICAN S.S.

The article attributes to our client conduct so inhuman and abominable that he is most anxious that the public should be freely informed what the facts really were. We have, therefore, to request that you will give this letter as great prominence in your paper as the editorial article in your issue to which we have referred. In the month of June last, the Biafra put into Grand Cess, to land some Kroo passengers, and, as usual, canoes came off from the shore to land the passengers and their effects. Kroo passengers learned from those coming from ashore that there was some dispute between the town from which the canoes had come and the town to which they wished to go, and where they resided. Not knowing how far this dispute had gone, or whether actual fighting had taken place, the Kroo passengers were afraid to land, and asked Captain Rattray to wait until canoes should arrive from their own town. The ship had already been delayed, waiting for canoes, and was behind time; so that it was uncertain when canoes would, if at all, come from their town. Captain Rattray informed them it was impossible for him to wait, but he offered to take them to Bassa or Monrovia.\n\nto land them there, and give them a note to the Captain of the next returning steamer to take them back. This arrangement was entirely satisfactory to the passengers, and they were landed by the steamer's boats at Monrovia, where the Captain gave them the promised note for their passages home by the Company's next steamer, giving them, in addition, a week's rations of bread and meat. From this you will see that Captain Rattray, instead of treating the men in the cruel manner attributed to him, treated them in the best possible way, and, for their accommodation, went much farther than there was any legal call upon him. We may add, that we have in our possession a duly signed and attested certificate to the effect that there is no truth whatever in the article you have quoted. We would only add, that the Biafra never was at Settra Kroo at all on the voyage referred to.—\n\nWe are, Sir, your obedient servants,  \n**Hill, Dickinson, & Co.**\n\nIn inserting the above letter of Captain Rattray, we beg to express our deep and sincere regret that we should have been misled into copying from the Monrovia Observer, and publishing in our columns, with editorial remarks on the same, the false and calumnious statement of which Captain Rattray so justly complains.

Do we ever hear of crime and trouble to the authorities arising from this—well, let us call it concession? The unanimous answer must be in the negative. It is altogether inconceivable why the United States—the champion of liberty—should be so backward in its treatment of so many of its best and most peaceable citizens. The debt America owes to Africa is incalculable; and she seems determined to deny her liability, even by way of recognising the social and political rights of the descendants of those who were brought against their will to labour in the fields and plantations of the New World, and thereby laid the foundation of its present importance and prosperity. From all that one can learn, the position of the freed Negroes is becoming more and more intolerable as the year of emancipation recedes into the past. Probably this is in no small degree owing to the fact that freedom was conceded to the slave merely as a political necessity, and not as in Europe generally as a result of the awakening of the nations\' conscience that a great wrong had been committed against Africa.\n\nFor the sake of our boasted civilisation, it is to be hoped that American citizens will come to recognise, before it is too late, that it is their duty, and also to their advantage, to accept the Negro as a man and a brother; to whom, indeed, no small share in the destinies of the world are committed.', 'last_edit_date': '1889-11-04', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/04_11_1889#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.591, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'MERCHANT SUPERCARGOES AT OLD CALABAR', 'section_title': '', 'content': ""Sir,—I beg to inform you that the letter which you inserted in your blessed journal of 23rd July last has very much displeased the supercargoes here, and they wish to know the party who wrote that letter to you and get him in their power that they may tear him to pieces.

The fact was that for the non-Muslim areas of Africa probably the most important single innovation of foreign rule was literacy. Even for the Islamized areas, the coming of literacy in the Roman script gave a new impetus to Muslim education. Literacy was for many African peoples a new magic, and was sought after as such and at all costs since it appeared to open the treasure house of the modern world. To know the amount of power, authority and influence which the first generation of African clerks, interpreters and teachers exercised is to have some idea of the spell which literacy cast over many African peoples.

Indeed, it was the Creoles, as the educated people of Sierra Leone came to be called, who pioneered most of the missionary and educational activities in the other parts of West Africa. Three typical examples were James Africanus Horton who was born in 1835 in Sierra Leone, trained in Britain as a doctor from 1853 to 1859 and entered the West African Medical Service as a Staff Assistant Surgeon; Samuel Ajayi Crowther who was one of the first products of Fourah Bay College and the first African to be ordained as a Bishop of the Anglican Church; and James Johnson, that fiery intellectual and evangel¬ ist.28 Others included Broughton Davies, who qualified as a doctor in 1859, and Samuel Lewis, the lawyer, the first African to receive a knighthood.29 Liberia also produced a few intellectuals, among whom was Edward Wilmot Blyden, who was born in the West Indies. Slightly larger were the numbers in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. In Nigeria, the elite included people like Essien Ukpabio, D. B. Vincent (later known as Mojóla Agbebi), H. E. Macaulay, G. W.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence. The interests of these settlers clashed with those of the Africans and they used their influence with the colonial administration to obstruct or stultify African development."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.717, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The main forces of change', 'content': 'Unlike urbanization, western education was brought to Africa by Europe, though not spread by her agencies alone. It is correct to say that the educational revolution in Africa was the work of three interest groups Christian missions, colonial governments and local African initiative, in that order of importance. For the Christian missions the school was a key institution, being the most reliable means for membership recruitment, and for creating self-perpetuating congregations whose members would ensure the survival of Christianity in the event of withdrawal by the white missionaries. Education and evangelization were so closely linked that for many parts of Africa the pitching of the missionary tent was synonymous with the establishment of a school. Among the Nguni the opening of a school is said to have preceded the opening of a church in all cases. 4\nThe colonial administrations, on their part, hoped through the school to raise the low-grade personnel they needed for staffing the bottom echelons of the colonial bureaucracy, to create such conditions - political, economic, social and moral - as would enable Europe to exploit as fully as possible what were regarded as the hitherto insufficiently tapped resources of Africa. To this end not only did colonial administrations erect and run essentially lay schools, they also supported the educational efforts of the missions by means of subventions. Furthermore, the political settle› ments they effected enabled the missions to penetrate the heart of the continent without fearing for the safety of their agents. The government lay schools were particularly important for the spread of western education in many Islamized parts of Africa where it was feared that unrestrained missionary activity would provoke violent reaction from Muslims.\nWith regard to local initiative, it is noteworthy that even before the onset of colonial rule, the rulers of Egypt and of the states of the Maghrib had introduced western education into their countries as part of an effort to bridge the technological gap between their societies and Europe. In black Africa local initiative also played some part in spreading education. From the 1920s Gikuyu cultural nationalists established and ran their own schools which, unlike mission schools, were sympathetic to Gikuyu culture. In Uganda and Southern Nigeria local rulers and elders joined with either the colonial administration or the missions to establish schools. In these places, too, some of the new elite established and ran schools, especially at the secondary level where the felt need for self-reliance at times led to the building of technical rather than grammar schools, independent of the colonial administration and the missions.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.705, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The new social structures', 'content': 'But not all those classified as belonging to the new elite in colonial Africa owed their membership of that class to education, nor did all those who owed it to education attain a uniform standard. As Professor Lucy Mair and a number of other scholars have shown, some gained entry into that class because they had made money from either large-scale farming or business and could help to finance the political agitation of their better educated but poorer brethren.$^{6}$ Some cotton and coffee farmers of Uganda, cocoa farmers of western Nigeria and the Gold Coast, coffee farmers of Ivory Coast and groundnut farmers of Senegal and The Gambia were able to gain membership of the new elite class on grounds of their success in that profession. Similarly, in West Africa especially, where many indifferently educated Africans were able to interpose themselves as middlemen between the primary producers and the big European commercial companies, commercial success also provided a ready passport to the new elite status. There were, however, others who qualified for consideration as members of the elite because they controlled mass organizations like labour unions and could give the better-educated elite the kind of mass support which they needed to convince the colonial powers that they spoke for the people. On the contrary, in East and Central Africa relatively few Africans gained admission into the elite group as a result of the deliberate policies pursued by the colonial rulers and the activities of the Indians and Portuguese and Greek petty traders. In fact, in many of these areas, the old central elite virtually disappeared.\nIt is largely this wide variation in their qualifications and background that makes it so difficult to define precisely in those terms who were the new elite of colonial Africa. One can thus justifiably argue that the issue of the rise of a new elite among any African people in the colonial era was largely a question of what amount and kind of educational and economic opportunities were available to the people and how far they put those opportunities to effective use. All the studies so far carried out on this aspect of the matter suggest that regions or colonies which witnessed the most intensive efforts in the propagation of western education and which offered Africans more opportunities for meaningful participation in trade and commercial agriculture produced the largest number of people of elite status.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.727, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and jingoism to hear it."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'The rise of new organizations', 'content': ""As already mentioned, the social effects of foreign rule were far from uniform throughout the continent. With respect to the spread of education, the triumph of the new economic forces, the expansion of urbanization and therefore the rise of the new elites, West Africa would appear to have witnessed the greatest advances, followed by Egypt and the Maghrib, South Africa, East Africa and Central Africa. If, on the other hand, in this matter we compared the colonial blocks rather than geographical regions, we discover that greater changes took place in the British territories, followed by Belgian- and French-ruled Africa with Portuguese Africa limping far behind. And even among the British territories, there was also a differential impact. The British colonies where substantial transforma- tions were registered included Egypt, Gold Coast, Nigeria, Uganda and Sierra Leone, with Kenya and the Rhodesias (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) coming after. And if we take individual colonies we discover that more changes took place in the southern than in the northern parts of Gold Coast and Nigeria. In Francophone Africa, on the other hand, the West African colonies would come first, followed by the North African colonies and then French Equatorial Africa. Within French West Africa, Senegal and Dahomey (now Benin) led the way with the other colonies lagging rather far behind.\nThe fact was that the spread and impact of the forces of change were controlled by more factors than any colonial government or African group was in a position to master completely. First there was the question of the length and extent of contact which the particular territory or geographic region had enjoyed with Europe by the time colonial rule was imposed. West and Southern Africa had maintained fairly regular contact with Europe from the sixteenth century. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, quasi-urban conditions of life had come into existence at several points along the coast - at St Louis, Banjul, Accra, Lagos, the Oil River's ports, Luanda, and at the Cape. These provided good stepping stones for the forces of western education, western Christianity and western commerce to penetrate the interior. The east coast of the continent, on the other hand, came under sustained European contact only from about the 1870s."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.703, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority. Every colonial administration saw change as the only way of modernizing Africa and fitting her into the orbit of the West to the latter's advantage.

The development of the intelligentsia was determined by the specific character of European colonization and relative access to education. The social 'ceiling' for Africans in the south was far lower than in West Africa where, in the absence of a permanent body of white settlers, Africans found it easier to become clerks or secure a job in the civil service. In Southern Africa, whites had monopolized all the employment opportunities that might have been open to educated Africans, be they in the administration, the economic sector, the church or other spheres of life.\nBy the same token, the intelligentsia in Southern Africa was from its inception closer to the people. This was due to the fact that, in these regions, it derived from the midst of the indigenous population and was not initially recruited, as was sometimes the case in some West African countries, from repatriated 'freed' slaves or their descendants. The regime of cruel race discrimination, of which Africans in Southern Africa were victims without exception, inevitably tended to bring the intelligentsia closer to the people. African intellectuals there found it more difficult to play the role of inter› mediaries.\nAnother crucial distinguishing feature of anti-colonial protest in Southern Africa lies in the fact that opposition to the colonial order was recruited, not only from among Africans, but from among the sizeable non-African populations - the 'coloured people', Indians and progressive whites. Consequently, Africans were the main but not the sole anti-colonial force, and this left its imprint on the whole character of the struggle. 6"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.712, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': 'Moreover, as a result of colonialism, the African himself was looked down upon, humiliated, and discriminated against both overtly and covertly. Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

This is usually provided through a diffusion of the culture of the colonizer through education. Attainments within the educational system established for this purpose provide the yardsticks for raising a new group of elites among the colonized society. However, the diffusion of the imported culture of the colonizer almost invariably involves not only harmonious culture contacts, but also culture conflicts, which could find expression in violent reactions from the subject people. Apart from this, there is always the problem of conflict of interests as between the colonizer and the colonized, the former working to perpetuate control, the latter struggling for self-fulfilment either through accommodation within the colonial system or through the recovery of independence and sovereignty.\nAs M. Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially. Having been educated away from their indigenous milieu with the encouragement that the education they were getting would lift them into the European world, they were men who were largely alienated from the masses of their people in terms of orientation, life style, ambition and expectations of rewards in material and social terms. 2 The barriers which the illiberalism inherent in colonialism erected against them were, therefore, a source of resentment, bitterness and agitation against the colonial regimes.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.71, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Conclusion: Africa on the eve of the European conquest', 'section_title': 'The changing balance of power', 'content': ""Similarly, most African leaders were very suspicious of European missionaries. Eventually many welcomed missionaries if they played down the factor of conversion and emphasized education. Many rulers welcomed the opportunity for some of their slaves, or even their sons, to acquire the skills of reading and writing as a key to the white man's knowledge, and as a basis of commercial relations. The missionaries were even more welcome when they taught new technologies such as the printing of books, house-building, mechanized farming, vaccination, and the like. They were also sometimes called upon to teach techniques for making guns, gun› powder and other strategic goods, or at least to assist with their importation. By the 1870s, it was becoming clearer that the process of acculturation was weakening the identity of the host states, and their resolve to maintain their independence. Missionary activities also became a factor of division conditioning some African states to support particular European nationals and others to oppose.\nPerhaps the most subversive of the European activities was trade. Trade provided a basis for co-operation between Africans and Europeans, as both had a mutual interest in promoting its expansion. African rulers had to regulate trade for strategic reasons and to ensure that the African state and African merchants derived as much advantage from it as possible. European traders, of course, also owed it to themselves to negotiate for trading terms that allowed them to make as much profit as possible. In North Africa, they had exploited the weaknesses of the Ottoman emperor to secure excessive privileges for European nationals by treaty, in return for help› ing to prop up the Ottoman overlordship, thus weakening the ability of North African rulers to regulate trade in their own domains. The Euro› peans also reserved the right to help themselves to parts of the Otto› man empire whenever it suited the concert of European powers: France defeated the Bey of Algiers in 1830 and laid claims to the whole beylik, and in 1878 claimed Tunisia, just as Britain was to claim Egypt in 1882."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.7, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""Even worse still was the impact of colonialism in the cultural field. Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant. The heart of Africa was scarcely beating. 48 Such views were not nature's decree but rather products of the fertile imagination of these chauvinist European historians; Africa's heart was beating except that the Europeans were then too deafened by their own prejudices, preconceptions, arrogance and"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.697, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Methods and institutions of European domination', 'section_title': ""'Native policy'"", 'content': ""Shortly after or concurrently with the military conquest and occupation of Africa by the imperial powers of Europe, Africa was overlaid with a colonial administrative grid which, while neither uniform nor simple, was welded out of a few commonly held ideas and beliefs. As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Peoples of other regions became involved because of the penetration of their region by pan-Africanist projects, American black writings, folk› lore, and the like, or more importantly, because of the initiatives of school leavers who went, in growing numbers from all over the African continent, to America for higher education.\nPerspectives were undoubtedly affected by direct and substantial inter› action of Africans within a particular black environment or set of influences. Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.706, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Colonialism in Africa: its impact and significance', 'section_title': 'The colonial impact > The impact in the social field', 'content': ""also created in some Africans a deep sense of inferiority which Afigbo has defined above quite succintly as 'a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future in short, a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of [and one may add subservience to] European powers' (Chapter 19).

Where the population was only sparse, that might be accounted for by the tribal warfare which prevailed, and which could be suppressed by the introduction of civilisation. What was wanted was that peace should be maintained, and trade encouraged, to raise the natives to a civilised condition. The native population was divisible into three great classes—the Arab, the Negroid, and the Negro. The Arab race they met from the Nile to the Zambesi, and in the Sahara, as well as about the Great Lakes. They were the merchants and the traders, while the Negroids were the occupiers and cultivators of the soil. It was singular that, while the Arab race had endeavoured to oust the British from the Soudan, they had assisted them at Zanzibar. It was difficult to deal with them, and it would not do to drive them out as the Moors had been driven from Spain. The best thing to do would be to make them useful in Central Africa, to deal with them as we found them, and to place in their way such commercial prospects that they might be induced to abandon the slave trade. If they once got the Arab to join them, they could easily put a stop to the butcheries of the negro races by each other. As to the Negroids, they were being gradually absorbed by the other two races. The most important race to the British Empire was the Negro, who was capable of being rapidly civilised. He could not raise himself unaided, and he still remained as he had been limned 4,000 years ago upon the Egyptian frescoes. Yet as soon as he was brought into contact with civilisation he took it up rapidly, and soon became a good clerk, an engineer, a cook, or domestic servant. The Negro was far less alien to our civilisation than the Chinaman, and in the course of about 300 years there would be very little difference between him and the European except the colour of the skin.

When we reflect that it is only five-and-thirty years since the debasing chain of slavery was removed from those of the African race in Barbadoes, and that this man, born within ten years after, should have thus wrung from French, Germans, and Englishmen such high and well-deserved tributes of loving gratitude, admiration, and praise, we experience a fresh stimulus to exertion for Africans in Africa to effect, as soon as possible, that every impediment to their progress in Christian civilisation may be removed, that every badge of their supposed inferiority shall be obliterated, and that institutions shall be planted among them calculated to foster and develop that worthy spirit of emulation to rival their European brethren which we regard as a powerful spring of action in the coming regeneration of Africa; and it does seem to us that both Sierra Leone and Lagos, which are the, at present, chief points of civilised commercial development on the West Coast, ought to lose no time in erecting in Sierra Leone and in Lagos a column on which shall be from time to time inscribed the names of those of the African race in whose favour the world may pronounce, as in the case of the late lamented Dr. Davis; and of others whose future services to Africa, in Africa and elsewhere, may, by universal acclaim among them, be deemed worthy to be had in undying remembrance, as worthy of honour and imitation by their brother Africans.', 'last_edit_date': '1870-12-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_12_1870#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.693, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""DR.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth. The book ought to be read and studied by all educated Africans, and we should like to see it have a large circulation in England, as we consider it calculated to arouse sympathies for Africa where they have never yet been felt, and to give them a vigorous impulse where they do already exist.

There may be many ways of accounting for this, but no doubt it must be ascribed chiefly to the fact that from time immemorial the white men who came to sojourn at Accra, whether Danes, Dutch, or English, were almost invariably of a superior class.\n\nTimes are, however, changed; the English gentleman is not now so frequently met with here as in days of yore.\n\nIn those days the white man lived in harmony with the black man. Being a gentleman, he did not consider himself degraded by associating on terms of perfect equality with the coloured man whose education, intellectual attainments, and self-respect entitled him to the respect of those whose esteem is of any value.\n\nHaving in view why exact English gentlemen deem qualifications, sufficient to entitle the Frenchman, the Turk, the American, Indian, or the Ashantee to move in their society, and having that feeling which pervades all real gentlemen, those white men, when they encountered black men possessing intellectual abilities and other qualifications not inferior to their own, were only too ready to receive them into their society, and too glad to be admitted into that of the natives. The European being a man of education and good breeding felt quite as much at ease in the society of the educated black man as in that of his brethren at home; he knew that his companion, though black, yet for all that, was a gentleman; and that was quite sufficient for him, and vice versa.\n\nNow-a-days, things are not exactly the same. The white men of the ancient type certainly do visit this country and sojourn for a period, but they do not, as of old, make it their home. They make their money and are off again whence they came, or if they be Government officials their term of service expires and away they depart.\n\nThe English gentleman has been to a certain extent superseded by the English Gent, a distinct class too well known and too well described and caricatured by their own countrymen, to render a description necessary here.\n\nThese men, whom the rage for the rapid acquisition of wealth has induced to visit our parts, or others to send them here to acquire wealth for them, arrive imbued with ideas common to all ignorant men—that is to say, if beings whose minds have such a limited scope can be said to have any ideas of their own at all, and not picked up second-hand from others only a shade less ignorant than themselves.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-01-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_01_1866#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.672, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'WEST COAST OF AFRICA', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In that letter Mr. Rosenbush, who has been eighteen years resident at Sierra Leone, states, as an incontrovertible fact, that missionary efforts have produced very beneficial results—that the most cursory comparison of the people of Sierra Leone, composed in a great measure of Africans liberated from the holds of slave-ships, with the natives of places where the influence of missionaries is not known, will establish this without dispute.

There was a large attendance.\n\nThe Lecturer, after observing that one of the most remarkable features of the century had been the phenomenal interest displayed in all things African, and that people\'s imaginations had been touched by the varied story of the Dark Continent, drew attention to the apparently unselfish form of the public interest manifested in Africa. The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence. They saw that the work of other nations had been pernicious in the extreme, that they had been brutal in their dealings with native races, and had thought only of their own sordid interests and national aggrandisement—all in marked contrast to their aims and methods.', 'last_edit_date': '1890-01-11', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1890#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.689, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'EDUCATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN TRIBES.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute, held lately in the Grosvenor Gallery Library, New Bond-street, a paper was read by Mr. William Greswell, M.A., on ""The Education of the South African Tribes."" The lecturer said: The future of South Africa was much bound up with this question of administration, and especially the educational part of it. A proper education meant an assimilation of the coloured man to the ideal of the white man, with regard to habits of mind and of thought. The question of education was visibly affected by political disturbances. With regard to the general question, which was viewed in many different ways by white people both in the colony and at home, he said the great desideratum of the hour in South Africa was to raise the discussion of important matters beyond the atmosphere of party. Nothing had so much injured the native as the custom of using him for the purpose of a party cry. Premising that he should confine himself principally to the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, the Lecturer said he should show that there had existed and did still exist in that colony a State scheme for the instruction of the natives in nearly everything they might require to know, whether it was to shoe a horse, make a wheel, or learn Greek. As he had himself endeavoured to instruct the Caffre in the Greek declensions, in his capacity as Government Lecturer in the colony, he might say that the loftiness and catholicity of the scheme had come home to him. Remarking upon the difficulties in the way of applying such a scheme in a sparsely-peopled savage country like South Africa, he said the number of white colonists at the Cape was about equal to the population of Leeds, and these had to legislate for the reclamation of more than a million blacks, who were scattered over an immense tract. Other difficulties lay in the unequal social developments among the black people, in the bi-lingual character of the white population, and in the want of unanimity on the part of the white colonists as to the proper lines upon which native education ought to go. To bring under one system of State education men of different religious views, hard though it might be, was an easy task for the political legislator compared with that encountered in an attempt to group under one plan men so intellectually and, if he might use the term, spiritually distinct as the European and the African aboriginal races. The difference between the races was, practically speaking, one absolutely of kind, not of degree. Undeterred by difficulties, legislators at the Cape had boldly grappled with the question, and they had established a complete educational ladder, with the kraal schools at the bottom and the university at the top. After going with some detail into the working of the scheme in that colony, and suggesting some possible improvements in the system, he remarked that though philanthropy in theory, in practice it was unphilosophic. A cardinal fact was ignored—the generic difference between the European and the Caffre. The principle of heredity was ignored. He was inclined to believe that the Caffre would be influenced by a simple and rather an autocratic system. Advocating a certain measure of compulsion in order to make the Caffre industrious, and to compel him to be taught, he said the educationist should walk hand in hand with the white magistrate and the missionary; these three classes of men really replace the autocracy of the chiefs. He thought that if the philanthropist could be persuaded to believe that all men were not equal, and if the Boer could be persuaded to believe that they might be equal in course of time—in fact, that there was a germ which might be worked upon in the native, there would be some chance of an agreement. If both philanthropist and Boer should take the scientific view that the Caffre was really nothing more than he was by descent, a savage pure and simple, but that he had in him the makings of a good citizen, there would be considerably less friction in South Africa.', 'last_edit_date': '1884-02-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_02_1884#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto. The possibility of such a thing had never yet reached my brain. At last, in colloquy with an old friend upon the Coast, the idea started up, and after due discussion, we adopted it.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.674, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Though Englishmen naturally think that English rule is best, other nations cannot be as thoroughly persuaded of the truth.

It may, perhaps, be reasonably held that the advance of civilisation will be more rapid than Sir George Goldie ventures to anticipate, and that some now living may see prosperous negro communities developing the rich soil of Central Africa, with their lives unshadowed by the horrors of bloodshed, slavery, and cruel superstition. It will be interesting in connexion with this subject to watch the outcome of Sir Alfred Moloney's proposal for the repatriation into his colony of Lagos of negroes from Brazil, as the success of this scheme would be a strong encouragement to the larger proposals to which Dr. Blyden has for many years devoted his talents—namely, the repatriation of the negroes from the United States. It is admitted by the Niger Company that they already have to depend largely in their territory on the services of their coloured officials, natives of the British Colonies, who have proved invaluable for treaty-making and diplomatic intercourse with the native chiefs, as well as for the development of new products in which the Company has apparently made rapid progress.\n\nSir George Goldie does not refer, however, in his article to two of the most important features in the policy of the Company.

It enables us to import those commodities for the production of which the climate and soil of foreign countries are best calculated, and to export in payment those articles for which our own situation is better adapted. It is virtually a mode of cheapening production, the commodities exported rising in value, and those imported decreasing in value, caused by the increase of demand in the one, and of supply in the other. At the same time, the manufacture of those commodities for which we have no particular facilities is decreased. Take cloth, for instance; the manufacture of cloth out here costs at least a fifth more than if imported. West Africa has great natural advantages for the cultivation of the palm tree; thus the manufacture of palm oil is carried on with great success. This commodity is enough not only to supply the wants of the people, but to satisfy the demands of England, Germany, and other European countries, which, owing to climate, are unsuited for the cultivation of the palm. Thus, from an economist\'s point of view, commercial enterprise of Europeans in Africa is good for three reasons. First, it enables us to profit by the inventions and discoveries of the Europeans, from whom we get steamers, canals, railways, and the minor advantages of art and science, and also a certain amount of refinement in dress and manners. Then, being dependent on each other for a large amount of comfort and enjoyment, it forms a powerful principle of union, and binds the society of nations together by the common and powerful ties of mutual interest and reciprocal obligation. And, lastly, by bringing us into competition with foreigners, the division of labour is carried to its farthest extent; it stimulates our industry, and forces routine to give way to invention. Commerce is the principal medium for the propagation of Christianity. In some West African countries, Europeans are at first only admitted for commercial purposes. Up the Niger and at Bonny, for instance, persecution of converts to Christianity, especially by slave-holders, was of common occurrence; but this has been greatly modified by the interposition of the European merchants. When making treaties with native tribes, the Consuls usually stipulate for religious toleration. Again, missionaries have to avail themselves of commercial conveniences such as steamers, and also of commercial protection and aid; how would the money for missionary enterprise be forthcoming but for commerce?

1250,Racial biases and indifference in Britain led to systemic injustices and denial of rights for Africans under British rule.,"The observations from both the ""General History of Africa"" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive account supporting the claim that racial biases and indifference in Britain led to systemic injustices and denial of rights for Africans under British rule. The textbook highlights the pervasive racial discrimination and humiliation faced by Africans, as noted by scholars like A. E. Afigbo and Ali Mazrui, exacerbated by colonial policies and ideologies such as apartheid and Social Darwinism. Despite their admiration for European culture, the educated African elite were never accepted as equals and were barred from European societies and living areas. Economic exploitation and deprivation of political rights, such as forced labor and the imposition of taxes, were integral to the colonial system. Cultural denigration was evident, with African art, music, and history being ignored or discouraged, and Africans forced to abandon traditional practices to be accepted into European institutions like churches. The systemic nature of these injustices is further illustrated by economic policies favoring British interests over African dependencies and the use of African labor under poor conditions. Resistance and protests by Africans were often met with harsh repression by colonial authorities. Complementing these observations, The African Times articles detail mistreatment and discrimination, such as the torture and flogging of prisoners without trial, deprivation of trial by jury, and abuse of police powers in Lagos. They also discuss the negative impact of the drink trade, persistence of slavery, and lack of adequate protection and representation for Africans in legal and governmental matters. The articles criticize the British government's apathy and mismanagement, which allowed these injustices to persist, noting the indifference of British officials and the prioritization of commercial interests over African welfare. Together, these sources illustrate how racial biases and systemic neglect contributed to the denial of rights and perpetuation of injustices against Africans under British colonial rule.","The paragraphs from the ""General History of Africa"" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that racial biases and indifference in Britain led to systemic injustices and denial of rights for Africans under British rule.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y. Kaniki have concluded that \'colonialism ... produced its own grave-diggers\', while Robin Maugham has maintained that \'on the tombstone of the British Empire\' [in which this racial dis› crimination was most overt] \'may be written ""Lost by snobbery"".\'$^{44}$ Both conclusions are unexceptionable.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

As a result of a delegation it dispatched to London in 1898 which met the Secretary of State for Colonies, this obnoxious Bill was withdrawn. From then on, the ARPS sent a series of petitions to the local administration as well as the Colonial Office protesting against various projected Bills. It sent two delegations to England, one in 1906 to demand the repeal of the 1894 Towns Ordinance and the second in 1911 to oppose the Forestry Bill of 1910.

In 1856, the system of arbitration and settlement of disputes between Africans and Europeans was institutionalized in a Court of Equity established at Duala.\nThe missionaries represented an important element of foreign influence. In 1843, Joseph Merrick, a West Indian mulatto, was sent to Fernando Po by the British Baptist Mission Society. In the same year he established a mission at Bell Town, and in 1844, at Bimbia.$^{21}$ He and his colleagues gradually built churches, schools, carpenters' workshops and, at Bimbia, a printing press. Local opposition was soon aroused by efforts at mass conversion. Conflicts with the missionaries became intensified in the 1850s because of smallpox epidemics, inter-ethnic wars and famines, and the British had to intervene to protect the missionaries and their converts. When the Spanish governor proclaimed Catholicism as the official religion of Fernando Po in 1858, the position of the Baptists became untenable at Clarence. Accordingly, Alfred Saker built a new settlement at Ambas Bay which he named Victoria, in June 1858. But local opposition to the Baptists continued to be high, especially as many of the Anglo-West Indian settlers at Victoria also traded in competition with the Bimbia population."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.631, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The British, Boers and Africans in South Africa, 1850-80', 'section_title': 'The Cape Colony and Natal before 1870', 'content': 'river so that an empty zone patrolled by the British police remained between the Kei and Mbashe rivers.

Colonel French asked the House to leave Ireland alone, so that the beneficent legislation of the last two sessions might have time to tell upon the country. The Solicitor-General for Ireland, on the part of the Government, described them as altogether opposed to the Bill, although he admitted that, personally, he would be glad to see a uniform jury law for all parts of the United Kingdom. After a few words from Mr. G. Gregory and Lord Hartington, Mr. Lambert, finding no support from any quarter for his Bill, withdrew it. Has Africa no friends in Parliament to denounce the ordinance which deprived us of the trial by jury? Is there no member in the House to ask the House to leave Africa alone, as Colonel French asked the House to leave Ireland alone? Mr. Maguire denounced it as a monstrous attempt at amateur legislation; but is it not a monstrous attempt on us Africans? Is there no offspring left of William Wilberforce, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Lord Brougham, &c., upon whom the spirits of their fathers have descended—to say as Colonel French said with regard to Ireland, when he asked the House in the same manner to ""leave Africa alone"" to enjoy the rights of trial by jury as we do in England—that it is a monstrous attempt? Mr. Lambert\'s Bill was to alter the system of trial by jury in Ireland by allowing the majority of fifteen jurors to find a verdict. Here it was not to deprive the people of Ireland of trial by jury, but was only to limit them to fifteen, and to this Bill of Mr. Lambert it was cried out, ""Monstrous attempt!"" across the table by Mr. Maguire, and by Colonel French on the other side of the House, who cried out, with that military voice which attracted every one in the House, so as to summons them to the strictest silence and attention, ""Leave Ireland alone.""

When, twelve months ago, Mr. Mackenzie entered the field on behalf of his Bechuana clients with unpronounceable names, he had everybody against him—the Colonial Office, the Government, the House of Commons, the Press. The whole nation, so far as it was articulate, was hostile to his project; and, for the rest, was profoundly indifferent to such black fellows as Mankoroane and his kinsmen. Lord Derby was Colonial Secretary, with the watchword, ""We do not want any more black subjects."" The Government, weighed down by fast accumulating arrears of work at home and a formidable mass of responsibilities in Egypt, looked askance at any proposal to undertake new responsibilities in Southern Africa. In Parliament there was a minority, led by Mr. Forster, in favour of action, but the majority cared nothing for Mankoroane, and was prepared with philosophical equanimity to witness the process of natural selection applied in its rudest and most brutal form to the uninteresting protégés of Moffat. As for the Press, it was indifferent where it was not hostile, and ill-informed where it was best-intentioned. The public, wearied by African wars and African affairs, was but little disposed to listen to the Tribune of the Bechuanas. Nevertheless, this formidable array of hostile forces did not disconcert Mr. Mackenzie in the least. For nine months after he arrived in the country he contented himself with surveying the ground and calculating the chances of success. He is not a rapid man. He is slow to decide; but when his decision is once formed it is adamant. After much pondering over the matter and many heartburnings, he at last felt it borne in upon him that, come what might, he must liberate his soul and relieve his conscience by making a determined attempt to compel his fellow-countrymen to hear reason on the matter. Apart from the sustaining influence of what he felt to be a just cause, and his belief in the overruling Providence, he was buoyed up chiefly by a conviction in the reasonableness and intelligence of his fellow-countrymen. ""If I can only make them see the facts,"" he said, ""I do not think there need be any fear as to the result."" And so he set to work to make them see the facts. At first there was a great outcry even among his own colleagues of the London Missionary Society. ""A great mistake,"" cried one of the most zealous of these supporters, ""to put that man Mackenzie up to speak at Exeter Hall!"" But he persevered. Nor did he confine himself to public speech: his pen was more influential than his tongue. He had never done writing; and two of his articles in the reviews enabled him to place his scheme for the future government of South Africa fully before the public. It was a large scheme, and an imposing one, and in these days of hand-to-mouth policies it stood little chance of being listened to, much less accepted. But it was listened to, and in its essentials it has already been accepted, and his articles on the territorial government of South Africa have become the text-book of British policy in that region. As Indian Viceroys used to read Mill on the government of India, so future South African administrators will have to master the articles of Mackenzie. He had many weary months to toil before he began to see much reason for hope. The rank and file of Nonconformists in the constituencies were first won, but their representatives in Parliament were timid, and, excepting through the vigorous protest of a few men like Dr. Dale, of Birmingham, their voice was hardly audible. Church people were cut off by a chasm not easy to be bridged from the Dissenting missionary of South Africa. Nothing daunted, Mr. Mackenzie put a stout heart to a stey brae, and toiled on. There seemed no limit to his activity. He interviewed Cabinet Ministers, he buttonholed editors, he haunted the lobby of the House of Commons. He saw every one who had any influence in the matter, and compassed sea and land if by any means he might make one proselyte. When the Transvaal Delegates came they imagined that they had only to come and see and conquer. If they had come nine months earlier, their anticipations might have been fulfilled. When they arrived, however, it was too late. Mr. Mackenzie had been beforehand with them, and, to their unconcealed chagrin, they found that the public would not tolerate their attempt to erect a Boer barrier across the great trade route from the Cape to Central Africa. Mr. Scanlen and Sir Hercules Robinson arrived in time to confirm the impression which Mr. Mackenzie had made; the Delegates soon found that the game was up, and that Bechuanaland was saved.'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE OUTRAGE ON MR.

At the time that he laid in his stock, his poor old mother, living with him, fell sick; the liquor was warehoused by the young man; and he, like a dutiful son, attended on his sick parent, intending to open a shop for the sale of spirits, wines, &c., so soon as the old lady got better. The invalid parent died, and the bereaved son performed the funeral obsequies in a decent and creditable manner. One week afterwards, on a Monday morning last June, he betakes himself to the office of the proper official, and tenders the money for a licence for the retail of spirituous liquors. A receipt for the money is handed him, the official telling Moses, ""Your licence shall be forwarded to you in the course of the day."" Up to this time the shop had never been opened (as was proved in court subsequently).

The consignees went on board, their cox and boatswains, sailors of H.M.S. Pert, and passengers, &c. The language of the captain that day was rather sharp, for I took a minute of it verbatim, as follows: ""Had I known that so many of these black fellows would have come on board I might have passed off to south before calling here.""

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

It seems to me an extraordinary thing that in all that is said about the impossible situation on the other side of the water, it is constantly lost sight of that these black people were transported thither forcibly and utterly against their will, and that it was only to be expected that an impossible state of things would sooner or later be created. There are two expressions in Mr. Edmondston\'s letter which appear to me utterly to misstate the case. He abhors the idea of \'Anglo-Saxon blood submitting tamely to the oppression of a horde of savage negroes.\' He also says \'there happens to exist within their borders an alien and inferior race.\' Surely, Sir, this is not a correct statement of the case. These American folk did not hesitate to use the labour of the black people without payment until the last war put an end to the bondage, but there are certain points that they must not refuse to consider if they desire to escape the difficulties created by this emancipation. Undoubtedly freedom was given in a sudden moment of enthusiasm and in response to a violent and forcible demand, and it is obvious that full enfranchisement was prematurely afforded. But such methods will not right matters. Two wrongs do not make a right. The determination to keep black people in a state of ignorance, so as to exclude them from the right to vote, is unworthy and impossible. Lynching is not going to meet the situation either. Both are utterly unworthy methods of bullying a weak and maltreated race. The true solution is repatriation. Why talk of planting British Indians in Africa when so many expatriated Africans will colonise it far more satisfactorily? I admit that Liberia has not been a success so far. But I contend that limited repatriation wisely directed can be made a success. Some of the \'back wages\' of these black people in America might well be used for this purpose.

Besides illegal slavery, there was extensively practised in Africa a system of native despotism which it was very desirable should be abolished. In 1876 nobody seemed to take any notice of Africa, and the exportation of India-rubber from Zanzibar amounted to something under £20,000. Now the amount was about £250,000! With respect to ill-health in that continent, he had found that some of the native treatments were by no means to be despised, and many of our English doctors could take a leaf out of their book. The record of men who had travelled through Africa and endured every conceivable kind of hardship proved that Africa had been cursed by the idea of its unhealthiness, a reproach which it did not deserve. The great thing required, however, was adequate communication. African travelling, under present circumstances, meant, at the outside, fifty miles in a week. At the present time every mile of railroad laid down in Africa drove a dozen nails into the coffin of the slave-trade, to say nothing of the immense impetus to trade and commerce which would thus be afforded. From Cairo right away to the Albert Nyanza was navigable water. There would be no difficulty in overcoming the obstacles of cataracts, &c., which modern engineering would easily surmount. The central high plateau of Africa was, to a great extent, in British hands, and offered the most important means of repressing the slave-trade in future. Every slave working at the present time was in direct defiance of the Act of 1873. Mr. Rhodes\' great railway, which would reach Zambesia within eight years, should be kept under British control, as native treaties were more or less uncertain. In 1876 they could have obtained all that is now German territory by holding up their hands. The Germans, however, are practically locked in. A dispute had been going on with Portugal as to whether the Zambesi was an open highway. Fortunately, owing to the twenty-one miles strip of land granted by England to Germany these two powers would be as one on the question, and in future arbitration claim the Zambesi as an open highway. A wise system of emigration should be conducted. He would like to see Indian planters transferred there, and Chinese too. Africa offered an excellent opening for the English working man, and it was desirable that the Government should protect its emigrants. The dangers of Africa were largely dwelt on nowadays, and its advantages were put in the rear.

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

In West Africa this meant a retreat from the liberal policies of the middle years of the nineteenth century which had made it possible for Africans to hold the same posts as the Europeans. The theory also led to a policy of segregating Africans from the Europeans in the urban areas. Not only were there European housing reserves, there were also European hospitals, European clubs and so on, distinct from those established specifically for the use of Africans. One effect of all this was to induce in the African a feeling of inferiority, a tendency to lose confidence in himself and his future - in short a state of mind which at times encouraged an uncritical imitation of European powers. Luckily, however, some African path-finders were nettled by it all into questioning the whole social and ideological façade of colonialism using facts from history and Christianity. By so doing they helped to prepare the way for post-Second World War radical nationalist thinking.\nAt the macro-level, then, colonial rule in Africa tended to transform racial distinctions into class divisions. A closer analysis, however, reveals that in no colony did all the Africans form one class. At first the pre-colonial class structure persisted, but in time the new forces of change occasioned a rearrangement of the structure, and the emergence of new classes.\nThough pre-colonial Africa provided many avenues for people of ability to rise in social status through personal achievements, its class structure tended to give an undue weight to birth. This was so to the extent that not only political offices but also certain honoured professions like priest› hood and smithing ran in families. Foreign rule was to bring about farreaching changes in African social structure by simply laying emphasis on individual talent and achievement rather than birth, and by providing many openings for advancement which lay beyond the control of the traditional manipulators of African social structure and institutions. Furthermore, its desecration of many African institutions and systems tended to undermine the authority and respect of the old nobility and to erode the awe in which they were held.\nColonial legal and moral codes, by abolishing slavery and proclaiming the equality of all before secular and divine law offered even the most underprivileged in traditional society the opportunity to rise in status, each person according to his ability and destiny.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.567, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Politics and nationalism in Central and Southern Africa, 1919-35', 'section_title': 'The economic and political setting in Angola and Mozambique: an overview > Popular opposition to colonial rule in Mozambique', 'content': ""Africano (The African Voice), pursued a similar objective as the self-defined guardian of African peasants and workers.

Remnants of slavery were suppressed because they had become anachronistic. Whipping and physical abuse of Africans by European employers was frowned upon and usually legislated against by the second decade of the twentieth century. Colonial states, like any others, tried to retain a monopoly over legal forms of violence. At the same time, they sought to reassure European investors or settlers that the power of the state was unquestionably at their disposal. Thus, whipping under the orders of employers was merely replaced by judicial floggings, which were resorted to in far greater measure than was the case with workers in Europe. African labour codes remained backward through› out the 1930s; breach of contract was almost invariably treated not as a civil but as a criminal offence; and the unilateral termination of contract on the part of African workers continued to be regarded as 'desertion', with all of the militaristic implications of this term.\nSome parts of Africa were more predisposed than others to a foreigntrade orientation, and some Africans had taken the initiative to establish colonial economic relations with Europeans. West Africans had been experimenting with new export lines since the early nineteenth century, while in contrast the population of German East Africa and the eastern Belgian Congo had turned to cotton and other export crops only when driven under the lash. The East African caravan traders had not brought as large a number of Africans into contact with European markets and European goods as was the case with West African pre-colonial trade.\nConsequently, the local population had no strong initial inducement to withdraw a proportion of its labour from meeting its own needs. Even in West Africa, however, the colonial states often had to bring pressure to bear on cultivators to ensure that they joined the colonial economy and that they did so on terms which European capital dictated. The fact that partition took place against a background of prolonged and recurrent crisis in the capitalist economy was of significance in this context. For instance, Europeans were desirous of an extension of groundnut production in Senegal from 1883 onwards when falling prices obviously offered no inducement to Africans, and taxation had to provide the dynamic 'impetus'.$^{8}$ In areas where dependency was entrenched by pre-colonial trade, colonial economic relations spread more rapidly and the amount of force necessary for stimulating the colonial economy was reduced although never entirely dispensed with."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.576, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'While slavery persisted, the majority of Africans and Afro-Americans served either as agricultural field hands, or in domestic service.

Occupation and biological heritage could and did increase class and caste mobility both during and after slavery. An individual or a family could work their way outward and often upward from slavery to freedom, or from free black to mulatto (especially in Brazil and Spanish America), or from mulatto to white (an exceptional achievement requiring a considerable amount of money) when the indices of race were more strongly cultural than biological.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'.

To those who moved from the assump› tion of racial inferiority of the black to the assumption that he would ultimately disappear from the face of the earth in the face of white power, Horton argued: we find that wherever the African race has been carried to ... they increase, no matter under what depressing and burdensome yoke they may suffer; from which it may be safely inferred that the African people is a permanent and enduring people, and the fancies of those who had determined their destruction will go in the same limbo as the now almost defunct American slavery. 40 Finally, in answer to the proposition that the black was incapable of improvement, he argued: 'Africans are not incapable of improvement, but that by the assistance of good and able men they are destined to figure in the course of time, and to take a prominent part in the history of the civilized world'.$^{41}$ Again in his Letters on the Political Condition of the Gold Coast, Horton wrote in the Preface: Horton not only condemned racism but was also one of the earliest advocates of pan-Africanism.

Contrary to general belief, such an approach is no ingenious discovery of the 'new' African historiography. J. S. Keltie's remarkable book, The Partition of Africa,$^{27}$ published in 1893, does note perceptively that the Scramble of the 1880s was the logical consequence of the nibbling at the continent which started some 300 years ago. It also gives a nodding acceptance to the view that the partition was economic› ally motivated although that is not its central argument. In the 1930s, George Hardy, the prolific French colonial historian, also demonstrated the local African dimensions of the partition, and he treated Africa very much as a historical unity. Like Keltie, he argues that although the immediate cause of partition was the economic rivalry of the countries of industrial Europe, it was at the same time an important phase in the longstanding contact between Europe and Africa. He suggests that African resistance to increasing European influence precipitated the actual conquest just as the increasing commercial rivalry of the industrialized nations led to the partition. 28 For a long time such views of the partition were ignored. But with the publication in 1956 of K. Onwuka Dike's classic Trade and Politics in the Niger Delta,$^{29}$ the African dimension of the partition was resurrected. Although Dike's book is limited in its time span and geographical range, it nevertheless encouraged a generation of historians to begin to treat the partition in the context of a long period of contact of different races and cultures. Unfortunately, while Roland Oliver and J. D. Fage demonstrate this extended relationship in their very popular Short History of Africa, 30 they still emphasize the European rather than the African dimension of the partition. It is therefore refreshing that A. G. Hopkins' important study,$^{31}$ although limited in its geographical scope, should attempt an African-oriented reinterpretation of imperialism in West Africa. His con› clusion is worth quoting: At one extreme it is possible to conceive of areas where the transition from the slave trade was made successfully, where incomes were main› tained, and where internal tensions were controlled. In these cases an explanation of partition will need to emphasise external pressures, such as mercantile demands and Anglo-French rivalries. At the other extreme, it is possible to envisage cases where the indigenous rulers adopted reactionary attitudes, where"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.049, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'European partition and conquest of Africa: an overview', 'section_title': 'The partition of Africa and the new imperialism: a review > The economic theory', 'content': ""Although Hobson and Lenin were not particularly concerned with Africa, it is obvious that their analyses have fundamental implications for its partition. Consequently, a disparate army of non-Marxist scholars has, more or less, demolished the Marxist economic imperialism theory as it relates to Africa.$^{6}$ A typical reaction of Marxist scholars to this apparent victory is that although the criticisms of Hobson and Lenin are basically correct, they are nevertheless misdirected. 'The target', writes Bob Sutcliffe, 'is often a mirage and the weapons inappropriate' because im› perialism, conceived as a general phenomenon, views the value of empire as a totality, and therefore 'a national balance sheet has very little meaning'. 7 A more compelling argument, however, is that even a thorough demolition of the classic theory of economic imperialism does not necessarily refute the conclusion that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses. To belittle other economic views of imperialism and then to jubilantly hang their proponents because of their suspected association with Hobson and Lenin is rather unscholarly. It is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that those who persist in trivializing the economic dimension of the partition do so at their own peril. 8"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.614, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}]","[{'id': 480, 'article_title': 'THE TIMES ON AFRICA', 'full_section_title': 'THE TIMES ON AFRICA', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_11_1864#article-19', 'issue_date': '23_11_1864', 'content': 'In editorial comments on Earl Russell\'s speech at Aberdeen, the *Times* says:—\n\n""There could hardly be a more crucial test of a sanguine belief in human destiny than a confidence in the civilization of Africa.

Pruner, of Egypt, in proof of the essential inferiority of the negro race to the European. In adopting this plausible line of argument, he is open to the objection of one-sidedness, seeing that all Pruner Bey\'s data are derived from an anatomical investigation of Nubian and Soudanese, consequently of barbarous and uncivilised human subjects. Dr. Hunt absolutely ignores the existence of every civilised and Christianised negro community in the world when he speaks of anatomical, craniological, and osteological matters. Deriving his data from an investigation of the anatomy of barbarous tribes, he places the negro facial angle at from 70 degs. to 75 degs., declares the weight of the brain and the mean measurement of the surface of the cranium to be much less than those of Aryans, and asserts that the negro brain bears a great resemblance to a European female or child\'s brain, thus in limine consigning the whole black race to irredeemable and absolute inferiority. If similar investigations were confined to certain uncivilised and barbarous Indo-European tribes, or portions thereof, similar conclusions might be arrived at.\n\nBut in the meantime, the black race is suffering from imputations which are believed to be groundless and unfounded. Mr. Edward Blyden, of Monrovia, in the pamphlet* which he published in that town in 1857, declares that in geographies, or books on ethnography, the heads given as representing the normal African are those of slaves, while those representative of the Caucasian race are either the heads of philosophers or of very beautiful females. They give the highest type of the European and the lowest type of the negro. Dr. Hunt and his friends similarly draw their facts from degraded tribes of negroes, and then palm them off upon society as proofs of the irredeemable character of the whole race.\n\nI have troubled you with these remarks, Mr. Editor, in the hope of inducing some of your readers on the West Coast of Africa, or elsewhere, to correspond with me on this interesting subject.

With the increase of desires comes also the determination not to leave any effort untried to accomplish that great object. We have not taken the matter up lightly, or in ignorance of the many obstacles in our path, whether they be such as seem to be inseparable from the administration of Crown colonies, the ignorant inertia of the population more immediately to be benefited, or the interested apathy or opposition of Europeans, who prefer, to use their own words, ""to let things go on as they are,"" because they imagine that with increased development and life, there will be more than a relative increase of commercial competition. The objects we have in view, the results at which we aim, are too widely beneficial on the one hand and too sacred on the other, for us to allow such impediments, on which we had fully calculated, to damp our energies or cause us to intermit our exertions. We know that populations steeped in heathen ignorance and sunk morally in the lowest depths of evil, where all the highest principles of humanity are violated, and the most debasing influences prevail and riot unrestrained, cannot be effectually reached by the piercing light of truth, without those facilities of access which railways only can furnish. The Gospel of the coming kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ must be preached ""as a witness"" to all nations; and we feel that by the construction of the railways we have projected, and their extension, this one great object will be facilitated, in so far as that portion of Africa is concerned in and through which their course will lie. But as it is contrary to all precedent to imagine that we could give birth by the enunciation of such views and objects to any such enthusiasm as would help materially in the execution of our plans, we must of necessity appeal to those material interests which move the mainsprings of human action, and influence both governments and individuals. We have been, and shall, we doubt not, again be told, that the subjugation of evil, and the ennobling of debased humanity are very well in their way; but that to loosen the purse-strings of Government or capitalists, we must be able to show the certainty of results that are more generally appreciated and desired. Will the proposed railways lead to such development of resources as shall ensure that ""they shall pay""? In view of what has been effected in other countries by such constructions, a really paternal Government would not hesitate a moment in determining to apply any available resources and powers it might possess to endow the lands over which it holds sway with such approved agencies in the creation of public and private wealth. It is becoming very much the fashion to laud and praise uncontrolled Imperialism as the great fountain of good to peoples. The administration of Crown colonies is an uncontrolled Imperialism. We thirst to behold the fertilizing streams of this much-lauded fountain flowing through and from our West African settlements and colonies, where, if anywhere on earth, there would be no impediments to their course. We long to see Imperialism at work there in a wise and bold encouragement of efforts for the development of material resources, on which the wealth and well-being of subjects depend. We see Imperialism active in subjugation; let us have a view of it working with beneficent regard to the wants and necessities of subjects who, through poverty and ignorance, are incapable of helping themselves in the midst of an abounding natural wealth. There is a rich field for its exertions in this direction within the Gold Coast territories. It will not do to tell us the people are naturally lazy, have very few wants, and have not, therefore, any incentives to exertion, such as could alone lead to the increased production and development of, at present, unutilized resources, as would recuperate the Exchequer for even the small outlay which is needed to convert our projects into realities. We deny it; and we appeal to facts in complete justification of our denial. We heard the same falsehood when it was proposed that there should be steam communication with the West Coast by the ships of one company alone every fortnight, instead of once a month; it thundered in our ears anew when another steamship company was about to enter the field, and communication once a week was established. We heard it some twelve or fourteen years ago, when the revenues of the British possessions on the Gold Coast amounted to only seven thousand pounds a year; and those of the Dutch possessions, intermixed with the British, were so far from paying the expenses of their government, that this entailed on the Netherlands a loss of some ten or twelve thousand pounds a year. Those possessions, which have since come entirely under British administration by the retirement of the Dutch, yield now a revenue of one hundred thousand pounds a year; notwithstanding errors that have enriched the French possession, Assinee, at the expense of the Gold Coast Treasury, and although no appreciable portion of the revenue has been employed for improving communications, and thus facilitating the operations of trade and commerce. These are undeniable facts. Are we not justified in appealing to them in support of our denial of the supposed invincible laziness, the paucity, or rather inelastic paucity, of wants, and the absence of incentives to exertion? And, let it be remembered, there has not been any internal extension of the area of production. There has been a small coast extension—only a very small one—but there has not been any internal extension, which could only be accomplished by the opening of roads, and the substitution of some other means for the conveyance of goods and produce to and from the coast for that of human heads, on which alone the tens of thousands of tons of produce and goods per annum have been and still are carried. If the greater freedom of action given to the people by the whole coast line being under one sole jurisdiction, and by the proclamation which enfranchised all domestic slaves who desired their freedom, while it prohibited any further transfer or sale of slaves or taking of pawns, has led to such a marvellous increase of revenue, surely it may be inferred that the people are not ineradicably idle, that they are capable of increased wants, that there are some motives or incentives which rouse them to action, and that by doubling the zone of production by the facilities which railways will offer for the transport of produce to the coast from districts too distant for conveyance on human heads, something like a hundred per cent. increase in exports, imports, and revenue will, within a few years, be attained. The country is one of marvellous resources, which never can be utilized, except in fractions, until the means for transport and more rapid, easy, and cheap communication are provided. We do not hesitate to say that there is not another European State—not even the so-styled lethargic Spain and Portugal—that would placidly fold its administrative arms in presence of so vast an amount of undeveloped wealth at so short a distance from its shores as the Gold Coast is from England, and fail to welcome and tender the willing hand of judicious assistance such as its Treasury might be able to afford to enterprise seeking to pronounce the ""open sesame,"" by the construction of suitable railways, that would place that wealth at its disposal and the disposal of its subjects. The manufacturing industries of Great Britain are calling for new markets, to take the place for their productions of old ones that are irrecoverably lost; but their great capitalists do not yet seem to comprehend the new order of things that has arisen for this country of Great Britain.

Broca and Theodor Wartz, and the villanous accounts of Count Gorz and Van Amringe, as well as the onesided and notoriously partial researches of M.

Dr. Hunt decries every writer who states that a pure negro has ever exhibited mental distinctions. If he should inquire in schools and colleges in England, where pure negroes have been educated, he will easily be undeceived in that point, and he will find that in many competitive examinations these ""analogies of the anthropoid apes"" have taken the first place, above several European students; but Dr. Hunt will perhaps say that was accidental.', 'last_edit_date': '1866-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1866#article-15', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.633, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': ""DR.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial.

We had buried our first-born there, a little boy of six years.\n\nBut poor Africa—what can be done for her? I rejoice in the success of Dr. Livingston, and of every other explorer and labourer in Africa; but much more need to be and can be done for her. 1. She needs missionaries and teachers, but these alone will not do the work needed. Accompanying them should be (2) farmers and mechanics, who can teach them civilization, for both must go together—civilization and Christianity: either without the other will fail; but both united will, with God's blessing, lift her up, and soon give her a place among the nations.\n\nShe has natural resources abundant. 1. The people are capable of being educated in the arts and sciences, in which they make rapid proficiency when an opportunity is provided. In managing business, mercantile or other, they manifest an ability equal to the whites. The richest men in Sierra Leone are negroes who were taken out of the slave ship. They make very efficient preachers, teachers, mechanics, farmers, &c., when instructed.\n\n2. The country is rich—very productive in many things needful for commerce and home consumption. Rice, Indian corn, and some smaller grains, suited to exportation, can be produced to any extent. Ginger, pepper, arrowroot, can be supplied to meet the wants of the world. Coffee and cotton of fine quality grow wild abundantly, and can be cultivated to any extent to supply Manchester and every cotton factory in Christendom. There only needs to do this to start it all along the Western Coast, and make a market for them, and the natives will go to producing them. They will work at what they can make the most money by. Africa is by far the best and most natural coffee and cotton country in the world, and, I will add, sugar-cane also. These articles are spontaneous products of the soil. Coffee is a forest tree, from twenty to seventy-five feet high, as I saw myself, and is cultivated with great care. Cotton grows to quite a bush, from six to ten feet high, and the same bush bears a crop every year; and sugar-cane, when once planted, will shoot up and make new crops as often as cut down. These things I have seen.\n\n3. And her minerals are rich and abundant. Gold and iron ore, the purest in the world, is very abundant in many parts.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.619, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'REVIEW.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'As we have often exposed European misconduct in these countries, we may be allowed to quote F.R.G.S. on the same subject: ""There are about 100 Europeans in the land; amongst these there are many excellent fellows, but—it is an unpleasant confession to make—the others appear to me inferior to the Africans, native as well as mulatto.

It is indeed a compendium. It places before us in brief but luminous sketches, and with the aid of sixteen admirable maps and some seventy illustrations, all that is publicly known about Africa and its peoples—their specific peculiarities, character, manners, customs, and condition, physical and moral; with enumeration of its varied products, its trade and commerce. It is an admirable volume for all who desire general information respecting that great continent, into the dense darkness of which the light of civilization and Christianity has begun to penetrate, through the devoted exertions of missionaries and scientific explorers. Africa does not present us with any very pleasing pictures. They are all of barbarism, and for the most part barbarism of the lowest and most disgusting type, and yet such as awakes and impels to active exertion the warmest sympathies and desires of the Christian and philanthropist. Such books as this of Mr. Stanford\'s are particularly valuable in view of the extremely limited degree of information respecting Africa possessed even by the majority of well-educated people in England. So many active agencies are now at work in and for Africa that some more intimate knowledge of it must be desired; while yet the labour of wading through long and dreary books of African travel, with their sadly monotonous succession of pictures of sparsely-inhabited countries, and of ignorance, suffering, cruelty, and moral degradation everywhere, deters most people from seeking it in their pages.

The articles frequently describe Africa as a land of chaos and barbarism, emphasizing the need for Christian civilization and European intervention to bring order and moral improvement. For instance, one article discusses the ""bloody tumult"" of Africa and the hope for European Christian order to emerge from it. Another article highlights the ""cheapness"" of human life in Africa and the need for Africans to adopt Christian values. These narratives reflect a colonial mindset that views African societies as lacking in moral and social structures, thus justifying European intervention.

However, the articles also reveal a more nuanced understanding of African societies, acknowledging their strategic caution in interactions with foreigners. For example, one article describes how local African communities were wary of European intentions and created obstacles to prevent further intrusion, demonstrating a level of agency and strategic thinking. Additionally, there is recognition of the negative impact of European influence, such as the demoralizing effects of the drink trade and the failure of European efforts to bring about meaningful progress in some regions.

Indeed, as it was declared at the Second Congress of Negro Writers and Artists in Rome in March-April 1959, 'among the sins of colonialism, one of the most pernicious because it was for a long time accepted by the West without discussion, was the concept of peoples without culture'. 45 But this should not surprise us. As P. Curtin and others have pointed out, 'The European movement into Africa coincided with the nineteenthand twentieth-century peak of racism and cultural chauvinism in Europe itself.$^{46}$ The Europeans who moved into Africa during this period, especially between 1900 and 1945 - missionaries, traders, administrators, settlers, engineers and miners alike - were generally imbued with this spirit and therefore condemned everything African - African music, art, dance, names, religion, marriage, systems of inheritance, etc. To be admitted into a Church, an African had not only to be baptized but had to change his name and renounce a whole range of traditional practices. Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ... [since] history only begins when men take to writing', 47 and Sir Reginald Coupland could endorse five years later the view that until the nineteenth century: the main body of the Africans, the Negro peoples who remained in their tropical homeland between the Sahara and the Limpopo, had had ... no history. They had stayed, for untold centuries, sunk in barbarism. Such, it might almost seem, had been nature's decree ... So they remained stagnant, neither going forward nor going back. Nowhere in the world, save perhaps in some miasmic swamps of South America or in some derelict Pacific Islands, was human life so stagnant.

The European domination which such an imagined social condition required was thought to be of long duration, which meant that the colonial hold on Africa would last into some unforeseeable future.\nAs for those few areas which already had large residential white minorities and were receiving still more such immigrants at this time, the anticipated future condition was one of permanency of settlement and of the continuance of European primacy in all matters relating to politics and property. Yet even in such territories - except South Africa where a policy of severely unequal segregation had already been imposed - notions of co-operative development were frequently expressed, and the African populations were at least officially enjoined to accept and follow European guidance.\nBeyond such considerations, colonial policy was without clear, final objectives. More short-range process than well-defined system, it vaguely included notions of self-government in its British form, and of political integration in its French and Portuguese forms. Broadly poised between these policies of 'differentiation' and 'identity', colonial administration of the inter-war era was described by its practitioners as necessarily empirical, an exercise in cultural and political accommodation.\nYet what seminal thought and experimentation that did occur were pre› war in origin. Following upon the 'paper occupation' of Africa in the 1880s and 1890s, the process of military conquest and domination occurred, and this gave rise to many of the methods of administrative control to be employed even before the century ended. As a result, the inter-war years were those in which many of these earlier practices were structured into official policy and in which administrative expediency was elevated to the status of well-articulated theory.

Though all societies were determined to preserve their sovereignty, the reaction to invasion was not uniform.'$^{3}$ Variations occurred in accordance with the social cohesion or otherwise of a given society.\nIn the 1890s - the period that preceded European occupation of East Africa - the societies of the region had achieved differing stages of social organization.$^{4}$ Some, such as the Baganda and the Banyoro in Uganda, the Banyambo in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and the Wanga in Kenya, had achieved a high degree of centralized government (see Fig. 7.1). In such societies, response to foreign penetration tended to be dictated by the king or the leadership as a whole. What had existed in Europe at one time - 'The religion of the king is my religion' - sums up the attitude well. Other societies, such as the Nyamwezi in Tanganyika or the Nandi in Kenya were in the process of forming centralized governments. This process is often referred to as state formation. However, the vast majority of societies in this region did not have centralized governments. But lack of central governments does not imply lack of government, a mistake which some foreigners commenting on African societies have made in the past."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.681, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Africa and the colonial challenge', 'section_title': 'The structure of Volume VII', 'content': 'Finally, only those historians who are really ignorant of or hold very simplistic views about the political and ethno-cultural situation in Africa on the eve of the European partition and conquest would use that term. They assume that all African countries, like many European countries, are inhabited by the same ethno-cultural group or nation, and therefore that any section of that group that allied with an invader could be termed a collaborator. But no African country or colony or empire was made up of any such single ethnic group. Each country or empire was populated by numerous ethno-cultural groups or nations who were as different from each other as, say, the Italians are from the Germans or the French. More› over, prior to the arrival of the European invaders, relations between these different groups were often hostile while some might even have been sub› jugated by others. To label such subjugated or hostile groups who chose to join the invading European group against their former foreign enemies or rulers as collaborators is to miss the point. Indeed, as will be demon› strated in some of the chapters of this volume, the nature of African reactions and responses to colonialism was determined not only by the ethno-cultural and political situation with which the Africans were con› fronted but also by the very nature of the socio-economic forces at work in the particular society at the time of the confrontation, and the nature of its political organization.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.702, 'probability_score': 0.051, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The social repercussions of colonial rule: the new social structures', 'section_title': 'Change and continuity', 'content': ""Any easy generalization on the response of African societies to the European impact is thus bound to be misleading. One must always bear in mind the territorial vastness of the continent, the rich diversity and variegation of African cultures, differences in individual and group temperaments and psychologies - and thus the fact that response to even similar stimuli was likely to vary not only from individual to individual or from society to society, but also from time to time within the same society and by the same individual. In Nigeria attention has usually been drawn to the differing responses of the Igbo, the Yoruba and the 'HausaFulani' to indirect rule. In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change. Indeed under indirect rule indigenous institutions and rulers were expected to serve as media for introducing reform in measured doses and in ways acceptable to the colonial authority.

If they were less farsighted, less fortunate or less well-advised, they would see their traditional enemies siding with the invader and would themselves assume an attitude of resistance, which could all too easily end in military defeat, the deposition of chiefs, the loss of land to the native allies of the occupying power, possibly even to the political fragmen› tation of the society or state ...

Indeed, as A. E. Afigbo has contended above (Chapter 19), one of the social impacts of colonialism \'was the general depression of the status of Africans\'. Ali Mazrui also emphasized this legacy of humiliation imposed on the African by the triple sins of the slave trade, apartheid and colonial› ism in his recent Reith Lectures. \'Africans,\' he said, \'are not necessarily the most brutalized of peoples, but they are almost certainly the most humiliated in modern history\'.$^{42}$ Thus, although, as has been pointed out above, the members of the educated elite admired European culture and went out of their way to identify with it, yet they were never accepted as the equal of their European counterparts, they were barred from the societies of the Europeans and were prevented from living in the European quarters of the towns, parts which Sembene Ousmane has called \'the Vatican\' in his novel God\'s Bits of Wood.* 3 Instead of growing weaker with the progress of colonial rule, this dis› crimination, which was propped up by the bogus racial theories and the Social Darwinist ideas of the day, grew in intensity, culminating in South Africa in the inhuman and bogus philosophy of apartheid. The educated elite therefore became disgruntled and bitter and it is not surprising that they were the first to develop a strong consciousness of the iniquities and exploitative and discriminatory nature of the colonial system and increas› ingly questioned the moral and legal basis for its continued existence. It was this very class produced by the colonial and missionary presence that was to lead the campaign for the overthrow of the colonial system. Some historians such as M. H. Y.

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...'' The French Minister of Colonies, Albert Sarraut, argued in his well-known study, La mise en valeur des colonies françaises, that the 'sole right which should be recognized is that of the strong to protect the weak'.

Nevertheless, the basic demands of the colonial system everywhere had the effect of modifying the purposes, , hence of distorting the functions of and weakening basic African institu› tions. The very fact that most African states were acquired by conquest and the exile or deposition of some ruling chiefs in itself brought the whole business of chieftaincy, for instance, into disrepute.

Even their right to interact with their African neighbours, except at the most rudimentary and un› official level, was severely limited if such neighbours now found themselves on the opposite sides of the line marking the boundary of a colony. For example, the Efik of Nigeria were severed from their traditional markets in the Cameroons, the Yoruba were prevented from taking a direct and open part in events in those parts of Dahomey (now Benin) which formerly formed part of their most celebrated empire, while the Bakongo of Angola could not interact to any significant extent with their kith and kin in either Gabon or the French Congo.\nFurthermore, foreign rule transformed and simplified the political map of Africa. Where formerly there were countless rival sovereign states and communities with shifting and at times vague frontiers, we now had a few dozen colonies with fixed and clearly marked boundaries. Attempts were made in international boundary conventions and treaties to take into account the pre-existing political and economic zones. However, such other considerations as the claims of the rival powers, the lure of natural frontiers (hills, rivers, etc.) and of lines of longitude and latitude tended to carry more weight than African claims.

Crowder has shown above (Chapter 12), the First World War raised the hopes of the emergent educated elites all over Africa for greater opportunities for their being identified with the processes of development in their respective communities. They expected to be absorbed and accepted as colleagues by the colonial rulers; but as the colonial situation became more and more of a reality they found their expectations checkmated or frustrated. Even where mass recruitment of European personnel during the war had led to job opportunities opening up for educated Africans, the realities of the post-war period soon caused disillusionment and discontent. Educated Africans not only found themselves placed in inferior positions vis-à-vis the European personnel of comparable training and experience with whom they served in the same colonial administrations, they were also kept in the background socially.

The plaintiff began to sue for forgiveness—though he had done nothing amiss—but this hard-hearted defendant refused to grant it, and left the boat, with orders that the plaintiff should not be allowed to re-enter, and went to the town in company with his wife. The plaintiff, relying on the feelings of the defendant, went into the boat during his absence, not being willing to be left at so great a distance from his home at so late a time of the day, it being between five and six o'clock p.m. But the plaintiff mistook his man. The defendant, finding the plaintiff in it, ordered him out; and when the plaintiff urged that he knew no one at Goderich, and showed reluctance to quit, the defendant told the men to put him out by force, and, as is alleged, gave his own assistance to effect this purpose, and even struck the plaintiff with his umbrella. I do not question the truth or falsity of the latter statement; one thing for certain I do know, that the defendant, according to his own evidence, committed a gross assault on the plaintiff; for Mr. Goldsworthy tells us that he took hold of the man by the collar of his jumper, and, having tightened his grasp, flung him away from the boat into the water. Here was a pitiful advantage for a high official to take of his African subordinate! Talk about the semi-barbarism of the Africans! Let those who delight in the use of the term look to Jamaica for a Ramsey, a Cullen, and others; and to Africa for a Goldsworthy, Inspector-General of Police. Not one of these is an African; they were all born in Europe, which boasts of high civilisation, yet we find them all acting in a manner which would put to the blush the veriest savage. These are the men sent among Africans as examples to copy. Mr. Goldsworthy, the defendant, stated that drunkenness was the main cause for his putting the defendant out of the boat, but I cannot readily believe this; for if it be true, then the question obviously arises, Why was not Wright likewise put out, who was equally drunk? Why was Shepherd made the object of his spite? Why was he left to sleep on the beach in the open air with wet clothes and without food, and Wright brought back in the boat to Freetown? The answer is easy. The plaintiff had complained of being hungry; he told the defendant so; and as this despot objected to the men speaking to him, this step of the plaintiff wounded his pride; added to which, the plaintiff, on being told to take in his oar, _looked_ at the defendant, which look was taken for insolence. All these it seems as if he were determined to resent; we see how the thing was rankling in his breast all the way, from the course he adopted with the plaintiff immediately on reaching Goderich, by telling him to desist giving his help in pulling up the boat. This seems to have been the mainspring which actuated Mr. Goldsworthy in his brutality to the man Shepherd. The plaintiff very justly refused to leave the boat which had brought him eight or nine miles from home, to a place where he knew no one; and if the defendant is right in what he did, then any captain of a vessel would be justified, under similar circumstances, to put any one or more of his crew ashore, unprovided for, in any place he pleases. Mr. Goldsworthy ought to have brought the man home, or if he could not do so with safety to himself, he was bound to provide him with food and a lodging. Suppose the man had died on the beach that night, what then? Would this defendant have been responsible or not? We have not only to do with what has really taken place, but also with what might have taken place. It is good for the defendant that so sad an occurrence did not take place, for then he would have found himself in the dock arraigned on the charge, if not of murder, at least of manslaughter. This whole transaction shows him to be unfit to hold his position; he is a hard-hearted and cruel man, with the feelings of pity completely crushed out of his soul. What is the use of keeping such a man in authority, unless it be to encourage the free use of his propensities for cruelty? Not satisfied to have the Government boat and men to pull him about on pleasure excursions, he must illtreat them too, by way of compensation for their services; because they are so many beasts of burden to be beaten and kicked about at his will. These things cannot be any longer tolerated in the country, and the sooner a stop be put to them the better for all concerned.""}, {'id': 3222, 'article_title': 'AN AFRICAN TOUR IN THE CAMEROON MOUNTAIN DISTRICT.', 'full_section_title': 'AN AFRICAN TOUR IN THE CAMEROON MOUNTAIN DISTRICT.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1876#article-16', 'issue_date': '02_10_1876', 'content': ""In January we left my house, accompanied by Mr. George Thomson, for our march across the mountain. At the close of the first day's hard walking we reached Mann's Spring, nearly 8,000 feet above sea-level, and there camped. The night was bitterly cold, and the water to us was delicious, but to the natives and Kroo boys very much too cold to be appreciated. They had to warm it over the fire before they dared put it to their lips. The next day we ascended gradually, until about nine o'clock, when we began to descend, all the time working round the mountain. After mid-day, until we camped about four p.m., we were all the while walking through country crossed and cut up with fresh tracks of elephants, but we did not come within sight of the animals. On the third day we passed several places where leopards had slept during the previous night, and about ten o'clock reached the first town or village since we had left home. If we had not wanted to go any further, these people would have been as amicable as could be desired, but, like all Africans, as soon as they knew it was our wish to go on to other places, they began to manufacture unreal hindrances. The whole of that day and the next morning we sought to overcome the difficulties, until at last they told us plainly that we could not go on. As the man was frightened he would get into trouble, seeing we had not come from the beach, and moreover we could not come by the beach, as the Bimbians would not allow us on one side, and the Calabar people would not allow us by way of Rumby, we could say no more, and were compelled reluctantly to retrace our steps. Mr. George Thomson, fearing the walk back, took our interpreter with him and went down to the beach, intending to hire a canoe to carry him to Victoria; when the people at the beach found we had actually crossed the mountains, and were evidently afraid we should find a way of getting into the country without their aid, they sent us a message that they would take us to the place we wanted to visit. When we heard the message, both Mr. Smith and myself feared it was only talk; but we determined to put the man to the test, so we fixed a day for starting in the boat round the coast, and made all ready for our land journey. On the day fixed, Mr. Smith was very unwell, and the journey was delayed for a few days. On the expiry of the few days Mr. Smith was still unwell, and had to be brought up to our house for change, when, as the season was so rapidly advancing, we agreed that if in a week Mr. Smith had not the strength to undertake the journey, I should go alone; and very much to the regret of us both, so it had to be, Mr. Smith remaining at Bonjongo until my return.""}, {'id': 3303, 'article_title': 'Rattlesnake Killing—Ashanti and Dahomey', 'full_section_title': 'Rattlesnake Killing—Ashanti and Dahomey', 'last_edit_date': '01-16-1877', 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_03_1877#article-5', 'issue_date': '01_03_1877', 'content': 'Sir,—Again the British Government are, according to the leading articles read in your blessed columns, preparing to kill another ""rattlesnake.""

This is the empire of Morocco, under the rule of a despotic Sultan or Emperor. Tangier is the only place in this vast country familiarly known to Englishmen. It lies, in a S.W. line, just 35 miles distant from Gibraltar, and tourists flock to this pretty watering-place in order to gain a glimpse of the wild Moorish life that exists so close to Europe. Crossing the Straits in one of the wretched little tug steamers that carry on the traffic, the traveller passes in three or four hours from the culture of English life, in Gibraltar, to the barbarism of the middle ages; indeed, he may be said to pass from modern to ancient history, for in dress, manners, and occupation the people are much the same as they were in the days of Abraham. Tangier is a beautiful city as seen from the sea—its walls and towers are white and shining in the sun—but it is full of the dead bones of a decaying, though once chivalrous, race. Its narrow stony streets, deeply coated with filth and mud, are crowded with a numerous population—picturesque to the eye, but squalid and poor to a painful degree. There are no wheels in Morocco. Not a carriage of any kind ever traverses the narrow streets of the cities, or the highways of the country. All heavy traffic is carried on the backs of camels, mules, and donkeys. This fact alone will show how deep is the barbarism that still exists in this great country, lying, nevertheless, nearer than any other to the very gates of Europe. The condition of the people is as bad as that of the roads, and may be expressed in the single word \'oppression.\' From the highest to the lowest, they prey upon each other, and any one known to have made money is almost certain to become a mark for those above him. A governor is appointed to the command of a province, and in due time he has succeeded in grinding out of the miserable people over whom he rules a sufficient sum to excite the cupidity of the higher powers. Without any warning, he is seized and consigned to a dungeon, where torture soon compels him to disgorge his ill-gotten wealth. So well do the Moors and the Jews understand the deadly danger of being supposed to be wealthy, that great numbers have applied for and obtained the \'protection\' of some civilized Power, generally France or Italy. Some of them have told me they would rather have British protection, but that the Minister of the Queen sets his face against this procedure.'}, {'id': 5208, 'article_title': ""KING OKO JUMBO'S MISADVENTURE"", 'full_section_title': ""KING OKO JUMBO'S MISADVENTURE"", 'last_edit_date': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'language': 'en', 'block_type': 'text', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1885#article-21', 'issue_date': '01_09_1885', 'content': '\n\nAnd when he gets home—how grievous the disappointment will be! The ladies of the Court, we may be sure, have come to look upon themselves as actually in possession of the vanities which their lord had promised them, and every one rejoiced in the prospect of looking at the objects with which his Majesty was supposed to be returning enriched. Alas! poor Oko Jumbo not only brings back nothing new, but he has lost all he took away. To return empty-handed is bitter enough; but when he thinks of those beautiful things all lying under the water in the mouth of the Cestos river his mortification will be immeasurable. Worse than all, the oldest inhabitant will shake his head and say, ""Didn\'t I tell you so?"" and the medicine-men will remind each other of their prognostications, and everybody will agree that travelling abroad is a foolish custom. For the King himself, it may be that will he agree in a measure with these pessimist opinions. He cannot easily forget how very sea-sick he was, nor are the incidents of the shipwreck itself likely to soon fade out of his memory. In travel, he will say, there are many pleasures not to be enjoyed here at home. There are wonderful things to be seen—and what travellers\' tales he will have to tell!—and marvellous things to do. But there are great discomforts also, and many dangers. How will he convey to his audience the idea of a railway collision or a gas explosion? To describe even a London street, with its torrent of vehicles, a railway station with its bustle and din, will tax his powers. Nor when he comes to speak of our shops will it be easy for him to explain to his listeners the variety and beauty of their contents. Fortunately for him, he can say what he pleases, since in African Courts it is not etiquette to contradict a King. Incredulity is liable to be followed by decapitation. So Oko Jumbo may exhaust language in description, and, above all, when he comes to catalogue the objects which were his for so brief a period, he may add to the number and exaggerate their magnificence without fear of critic or sceptic. All the same, the recollection of his loss is hardly likely to assuage his grief, and whenever any adventurous subject seems bent on voyaging, the precedent of his Sovereign\'s calamity is sure to be cited for his warning. What Oko Jumbo himself failed to accomplish, is it likely any common person will succeed in? He, the King, went forth and was sea-sick all the way there and back again. Going, he was nearly wrecked; coming back, he was quite. What did he gain by the venture? It is good, perhaps, to know of countries where men ride about the streets in carriages dragged by large quadrupeds of a more or less ferocious character, and travel in machines which are liable to be smashed into chips at any minute by a collision; who live in houses undermined by pipes filled with explosive air; who make lightning to illuminate their streets; and go about on the sea in ships which burst. But are not these doubtful pleasures? So long, they will say, as one goes on foot, there is no risk of horses bolting with you, engines charging down embankments, or boilers exploding; and the only way to be safe from gas and electric light is not to have any. But, as for the ladies, many gentle hearts will be saddened by the non-appearance of those red beads and that calico with yellow flowers on a scarlet ground. It is a pity, then, that the voyage should have ended so wretchedly.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

Our national Egbo, the most sacred boon that binds our laws, and by which order is preserved throughout Calabar land, has become almost a nonentity; so much so, that any European agent is free to purchase and wear Egbo; which destroys the social bearing of the country. It might be said that we sold Egbo to them. This is true, but it was not for the purpose for which they are utilizing it. The weak and poor of our country have no protection now; whereas, formerly, the protection of property and person, the poor and the helpless, was sacredly regarded by our laws. And even when person and property were not considered safe enough, the late Consul Hopkins—the most generous-minded of all Her Britannic Majesty\'s representatives we have yet had—did much to ameliorate our condition, by an agreement which both European missionaries and merchants agreed to. Now our people are not only violating several articles of this compact, but the Europeans themselves, who signed it, assist in modifying the most stringent ones. The missionaries shut us out from the knowledge of things. It may be because we are Calabar; therefore we are not to be taught, and our children made happy by good instruction and better training. We doubt not that good people in Europe have our interest at heart. But, as the result of half European influence among us, we have become very degraded in morals; life and property are less safe than hitherto, and the weak and poor have no protection. On one occasion, one of our native gentlemen—a chief, too—was dragged from his residence, though ill almost to death, and put in irons for a good length of time; yet no notice was taken of this outrage. This was not a poor man even, but an able chief of his country. And, what made it worse, this was done at the very time that the Consul was in the town. One might be surprised at the Consul\'s callousness, and ask, why was his attention not drawn to this treatment? The chief received this disgraceful treatment from his people simply for sheltering a poor, weak, and helpless woman who was shamefully wronged and maltreated by her divorced husband, and for endeavouring to redress her grievance. As the woman had appealed to the chief without getting any satisfaction, she was ultimately constrained to appeal to the Consul in writing ""knowing that, as an Englishman, and a representative of a country where the dignity of women is respected, he will go into the case, and mete out to the guilty one such punishment as his crime deserves.""

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs. It shows nice powers of observation—great diligence—a clear appreciation of facts, and a mental daring that does not shrink from the great problems of the future of the various divisions of his race, on which the light of Christian civilisation is only now beginning to shine, and who are for the most part placed under circumstances most unfavourable to its increase. After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries. Showing us their actual condition, and exposing many errors of administration which are opposed to material development and social advancement, he views the whole in connexion with the resolutions of the late House of Commons Committee, 1865, recommending the preparing of the several people for self-government. He shows the great changes that must be induced and fostered to make such self-government possible, safe, or beneficial. Though he has evidently a deep and, we believe, a just faith in his race, he does not shut his eyes to any of the disadvantages of their actual position and the difficulties in the way of their progress toward Christianity, civilisation, and wealth.

The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races.

It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters.

The very atmosphere was electric with the most wonderful schemes—religious, philanthropic, and commercial—for the exclusive benefit of the negro. From platform and pulpit rose a clamour of voices, in which was heard the popular watchwords of the day—civilisation, progress, the good of the negro, legitimate commerce, conversion of the heathen, and other high-sounding phrases, all having relation to the good things to be done for the African. The company-promoter freely sprinkled his prospectuses or his conversation with glowing accounts of the great benefits which the African was to derive from intercourse with Europe. They were told to picture as the result the negro clothed and in his right mind, alternately sitting at the feet of the missionary and the trader, learning from the one the truths of a higher and better life, and from the other acquiring the arts of civilisation. They never heard now of the trader who went to Africa with the merely selfish object of making his fortune. Each and all became pioneers of civilisation, thinking only of the native first and self afterwards. They spoke as if the good to the native had been enormous, and that their intercourse with him had been a benefit and blessing. They pointed with pride to their sacrifices in the suppression of the slave trade, to their West Coast settlements as centres of secular light and leading; to their missionary stations as stars twinkling in the night of heathendom; to the returns of their trade with every entrance to the heart of Africa, as showing the spread of their beneficial influence.

When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule.

Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best.

Perfectly true, he said, because there was no bright one as seen in the bird's-eye view he had been taking. What was a missionary here and there compared with the thousand agents of commerce who, with untiring and unscrupulous industry, dispensed wholesale the deadly products of Europe? What was a Bible or a bale of useful goods in opposition to the myriad cases of gin—the thousand guns which competed with them? What chance had a Christian virtue where the soil was so suitable for European vice? But he would be presenting to them an entirely misleading picture of the situation if he restricted himself to the distant and general prospect. A closer and more detailed examination revealed many bright points in the night-like darkness of Africa; and of these none scintillated with a more promising light than the enterprises of the Christian missionary. And yet, however promising for the future, when they looked around and saw with what rapid strides the emissaries of Islam had made their influence felt throughout the whole of the Central and Western Soudan, and left the mental and spiritual impress of their civilisation upon the natives, they could not but sadly wonder at the comparatively small headway that their Christian rivals had made against the sodden mass of heathendom. As compared with the good work of Mohammedanism in Africa, Christianity in these lands had been practically a failure. Wherever Mohammedan seed had been planted there it had taken root, and there it had remained to flourish with a vigorous grip of the soil which nothing could destroy. The same could not be said of Christian seed. It had ever been as a delicate exotic, difficult to plant, more difficult to rear, and ever needing outside support and watering. The Mohammedan missionaries had been men like the natives themselves, men who spoke the same language, lived the same life. On the other hand, the Christian worker had accomplished so little because he had tried to do so much. He had seldom comprehended the problems he had had to face. His education has rarely been adapted to the work before him, and filled with much enthusiasm and ardour and more erroneous ideas, he had gone forth too often to do little more than throw away his life with but small result to the cause he had at heart. Before any great advance would be made in the Christian propaganda in Africa a total revolution in the methods of work must be accomplished.

For thousands of years the northeastern portions of Africa witnessed a wonderful development of civilisation. The arts and sciences flourished in Egypt, and that country was the centre of universal influence; but no effect was produced upon the interior.

There is absolutely not a single place, where the natives are left to their own free-will, in which there is the slightest evidence of a desire for better things. The worst vices and diseases of Europe have found a congenial soil, and the taste for spirits has risen out of all proportion to their desire for clothes—the criterion with many of growth in grace.\n\nThe inaptitude of the natives for civilization is nowhere shown more distinctly than among the Kru-boys, a tribe which every one admits is the most docile, the most manageable, and most intelligent on the coast.

Lord Aberdare is Governor of the Royal Niger Company, and Sir George Taubman-Goldie Deputy-Governor; and in conversation with the latter a representative elicited some information as to the operations of the corporation. First of all, as to the difficulties which such companies have to encounter, they may be put down under three heads. The first great obstacle is this, that negroes have everything to learn. They have been accustomed hitherto to supply their immediate wants, and nothing more, so that beyond this minimum they have to be taught everything. It is slow work to teach them how to produce articles which are in request in Europe. A trade has been gradually growing up, but that only extends to certain regions, and, unfortunately for Western Africa, the articles of trade which have thus come into use—palm oil, for instance—have fallen very largely in price, as much as 50 per cent. That has been one of the great difficulties of the past three or four years. In the second place, there is the labour difficulty. Being unaccustomed to labour, they are averse to it. The Niger Company has had less to contend with in this respect than those in other parts of Africa, for although the natives near the coast are naturally idle, those in the interior are of more industrious habits. Some day imported labour will be necessary—either Chinese or coolie—not to extirpate the natives, but to serve as an example. The third great difficulty is the climate. Near the seaboard the country is undoubtedly pestilential. As you leave the mangrove swamps and palm forests behind and reach the interior, you come to a climate which, while totally unfit for European colonization, is fully as healthy as many parts of India. The difficulties arising from the climate are, therefore, not insuperable, if proper precautions are taken.\n\nWith respect to European jealousies and interference, there seems no ground for alarm on that score. The newspapers have reported that German merchants have complained of the administration of the Niger Company, but as a matter of fact there is not a single German trader in the whole of the Company's territory. There was one some time ago, but he was tried and deported by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., for a long period Chief Justice of the Gold Coast Colony, and now of the Niger territories. His offence was inciting the natives to rebellion and bloodshed.

From 1840, when the first mission doctor arrived in Sierra Leone, there were across West Africa a scattering of medical missionaries including some Africans (mostly Sierra Leoneans). These services were concentrated very largely on saving the soldiers, administrators and missionaries, although some care was also extended to African troops, government workers and mission personnel. Real success was achieved only at the beginning of the present century, as is shown by the crude death rates for European officials in the Gold Coast which fell from a level of 76 per thousand in the last two decades of the nineteenth century to' 31, 22 and 13 respectively in 1902, 1903 and 1904, and even taking age composition into account, compared favourably with levels in Britain from about 1912.$^{78}$ The explanation was held to be sanitary measures against malaria and yellow fever, improved methods of treating tropical diseases, and segregated living quarters. The sanitary measures must have had some impact on the relatively small number of Africans living in the chief administrative centres, especially in Lagos after the measures taken in the first years of the present century by Governor William McGregor and Dr Ronald Ross (who had identified the mechanism of malarial spread). The use of European methods to improve African health was relatively insignificant, partly because Europe offered more temptations after the First World War and partly because colonial powers cut back on health expenditures with the onset of the depression of the 1930s. In 1924 Nigeria had a theoretical medical establishment of one doctor for every 200000 persons, but in fact only a quarter of these posts were filled. Indeed, by 1939 there was a lower ratio of doctors to population in the country than there had been in I9i4. 79 Even these figures exaggerate the chance of an African receiving health care, for in the 1930s twelve hospitals met the needs of 4000 Europeans, while fifty-two hospitals catered for 40 million Africans. 80 In the absence of many doctors, extensive treatment services really depended on whether rural clinics could be established providing adequate care with the services of medical auxiliaries and whether local self-help projects could be organized.

African instability had been exacerbated by the European contact. In any case it was almost certainly exaggerated by both European administrators and missionaries, each seeking to justify the kind of new order that they had brought.

The French treated huge numbers of individual cases, especially noteworthy being the work of Dr E. Jamot using the arsenical compound, atoxy. One area of 124000 people in the Cameroon, which was treated this way, was recorded in 1924 as having a crude death rate of 81 per thousand of which 36 points could be attributed to sleeping sickness; by 1930 the epidemic there was being beaten.

By 1927 a vaccine had been developed in the Rockefeller laboratories in Yaba on the outskirts of Lagos, but, as it was not used on a large scale until the Second World War, any success against the disease up until 1935 was due to the suppression of mosquitoes in urban areas and the use of mosquito netting.

The other is the possibility that the population has not been stationary, but has been averaging a rate of growth of up to 0.5 per cent per annum for several centuries (for reasons which will be discussed below). The full range of possibilities allows us to describe a society where women averaged 5.5-7 live births yielding a birth rate of 42-50 per thousand, and where the expectation of life at birth was 20-30 years yielding a death rate of 38-50 per thousand and an infant mortality rate of 250-375 deaths per thousand live births. A medium assumption might be a situation where women averaged little more than six live births, where population growth averaged 0.33 per cent, where the expectation of life at birth was about 22.5 years (about the level of Rome at the end of the Republic)$^{20}$ and where the crude birth rate was about 48 per thousand, the crude death rate 45 per thousand and the infant mortality rate 300-350 per thousand.

My last journey extended over a period of eight months, six of which was in the wet season, and during almost the whole of that period I was either travelling in the bush or canoeing on the Ancobra river, yet I never suffered from any serious illness or required the services of a medical man. I have lived nearly ten years in the south and south-west of the United States, and found portions of that country far more malarious than the Gold Coast. During my visits to Axim I could not ascertain that any white man had died there from fever contracted on the spot during the past twelve or thirteen years. Nearly all the Government officials are stationed immediately on the coast-line, although it has been proved that the healthiness of the climate improves as one proceeds inland. At a distance of seventy to one hundred miles up the Ancobra river the features of the country change; numerous steep hills are met with, and many of the streams contain clear water running over rock and gravel beds. This is especially the case in the Appantoo, Broomassie, and Takwa districts. During my last journey I stayed several days at the Appantoo Mine, and gathered that, although for the past two years there had been on an average ten white men constantly employed, yet during the whole of that period not one man had died, and in the aggregate not more than two weeks\' time had been lost through sickness.""\n\nMr. J. Desmond McCarthy, late chief medical officer of the Gold Coast, does not bear such favourable testimony. He observes that, ""Having been Colonial Surgeon of Lagos for eight years and Chief Medical Officer of the Gold Coast for eight more, I think I can speak with some amount of authority on the subject of the nature of the climate of that region and its effects on the health of Europeans. I shall content myself with referring to my last three or four sanitary reports on the Gold Coast, which will be found in the Blue-books at the Colonial Office, in which are included the vital statistics of the Coast gathered with care from the most reliable sources, and submitted to the Governor of the Colony, for the information of the Secretary of State. In these reports are given the death and invaliding rates occurring among Europeans of all classes serving at the time on the coast. The greatest care was always taken to obtain reliable data on these subjects both from members of the medical staff and the district commissioners at out-stations, and I had every confidence in the accuracy of the reports submitted to me by these officials. I have not copies of the Blue-books by me, but they are easily obtained, and if Mr. Bridges would care to consult them he would find, from the vital statistics recorded therein, his estimate of the climate of the Gold Coast to be misleading.""\n\n[Oct. 1, 1895.\n\n---'}]","[{'document_title': 'THE CLIMATE OF THE GOLD COAST', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Mr. Bridges’ contention that, taken generally and under proper precautions, the climate of the Gold Coast was not so unhealthy as usually represented was supported by a communication from Mr. L. Wyatt, late Commissioner Axim District, who gives his experience of the district, extending over a period of seventeen or eighteen years. He observes, like Dr. McCarthy and Mr. Bridges: “I have had a very considerable experience of the climate, having been in the Colony more or less since 1877 to July 1894, and that my experience of the climate is favourable. I have seen more fever in parts of India (such as Peshawur) than I have on the Gold Coast. Like all densely-wooded tropical countries it is more or less malarious, but certain localities are much worse than others. With due precautions, temperance, and good food, white men can and do enjoy in certain parts of the country good health for years. Dr. McCarthy’s experience has (to the best of my belief) been confined to the immediate coast-line itself, where for all practical purposes sanitation is non-existent (a feeble attempt has lately been made in this direction) and such conditions exist that even in the Temperate Zone the mortality would be heavy. Dr. McCarthy speaks of Lagos, a place surrounded with vast swamps; Accra, also with swamp and low-lying land at the back, and known to be unhealthy; Cape Coast, yet worse; Elmina, also with a foetid swamp; and none of these places are supplied with really wholesome drinking water. The port of Axim (and it is with this district that Mr. Bridges is more immediately acquainted) is comparatively healthy, and during the many years that I have been associated with it I cannot remember an instance of the death of a white resident. As the interior is penetrated the climate improves, and splendid drinking water is everywhere obtainable. The district is extremely hilly and practically no swamps exist, the land gradually attaining a higher elevation, culminating in the Kong Ranges. At a short distance from Accra in the Aburrie Hills, white missionaries and their children have lived for years. The Adansi Hills, at no great distance, are known to be comparatively healthy. In the Apintoe district, where many white men are employed on the Appantoo Mine, health is well maintained: to my own knowledge many white miners have worked for two years consecutively and retained perfect health, and I have known many others who have retained their health for years and years. Personally, I have remained considerable periods, and, like Mr. Bridges, my experience has been the same—no ‘serious’ illness. Beyond the comparatively narrow forest belt, the higher lands are reached where horses, cattle, and sheep thrive, and the people are really more civilised and more intelligent than those of the coast-line. If Mr. Chamberlain will but carry out the professed intention of the Government of constructing railways to the interior, a region will be opened out to capital and enterprise far exceeding South Africa in its auriferous wealth, and with a climate probably as good as many parts of Mashona and Matabeli; in addition a large area would be opened up as a market for British goods, in exchange for valuable natural products. During the last 400 years (Elmina was founded in 1482) Europeans appear to have clung persistently to the coast-line, many parts of it low and swampy, and the river deltas are naturally hot-beds of fever (not singular to West Africa); even in two, at least, of the Eastern counties of England, malaria is not unknown. All the most ordinary rules and precautions for the preservation of health were set at naught. The white men sent out, being generally from an inferior stratum of society or compelled to leave their country for pertinent reasons, led wild and reckless lives—‘a short life and a merry one’ was their motto. It can be no matter of astonishment that the coast climate should, under such conditions, have attained to an evil reputation. Such conditions are now being modified, and men of a much higher class are now in that part of Africa seeking profit and adventure. To absolutely condemn the whole of West Africa on such grounds appears absurd. As well condemn the climate of the whole of South Africa by reason of the extreme unhealthiness of portions of the low-lying belt on the east and south-east coasts. I certainly think that Dr. McCarthy has taken too pessimistic a view of the matter. In his own person he shows that he himself has been able to stand the climate of West Africa for seventeen or eighteen years, and now finds himself comfortably at home in Kent.”', 'last_edit_date': '1895-10-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_10_1895#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.671, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Sir,—A very large holder of shares in the West African Gold Mines has called my attention to a paragraph which appeared in the Daily News of March 17th, in which a correspondent of that journal ""earnestly expresses a hope that those who are offered shares in Gold Coast Mines will inform themselves of the deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" and also asserts that ""a white man cannot live there and work; the natives cannot be induced to work: as soon as a road is made the jungle grows over it again; the air is poisonous; and the people are debased beyond conception.""\n\nHaving first landed on the West Coast of Africa exactly thirty-one years ago, since which time I have spent less than six years in Europe, the remainder of the period being passed on the Coast, the Gold Coast Colony included, and, moreover, having returned from a visit of six months to the Gold Mines so recently as the end of July last, I trust that you will kindly permit me to contradict, in the most unqualified manner, all the statements of the unknown correspondent of the Daily News.\n\nThe mere fact that I have passed more than half my life in Western Equatorial Africa, including one continued residence there of ten, and another of five years, and am now in good health, and that I can name many Europeans and Americans who have spent as many, if not more, years there, is in itself a sufficient refutation of the supposed (and quite illusory) ""deadly nature of the climate for Europeans,"" when they are not constitutionally unfitted for residence in tropical regions, and will take proper care of themselves, and listen to the advice of ""old Coasters.""

I could give you a list of a dozen or more personal friends, mostly traders, who have been on this Coast from ten to twenty years each, and are still strong, healthy men: it is true they have occasionally visited Europe during that time. Many young men shorten their lives by excess, carelessness, and exposure; *but I doubt if they would live long anywhere if they led such dissipated lives as they do here.* ""Climate"" is a common slang term for ""brandy,"" and is frequently employed ironically in that sense, because it is so much the fashion to attribute every death to ""that horrid climate,"" when those better informed know that a large proportion of Europeans hasten their own end by drink. One officer included among the victims of the Ashantee war was found dead in his bed, with a brandy bottle, nearly empty, under his pillow—at least, so ill-natured people said. Another victim of the said war died of epilepsy at Lagos, poor fellow! in fact, the ""war"" had to bear the blame of every death occurring among the troops at the time.\n\nThe much-abused traders, or ""palm-oil ruffians,"" as naval and military *gentlemen* politely term them after eating their dinners, drinking their wine, and perhaps winning their money, certainly undergo as many hardships and privations on many parts of the Coast as do their countrymen of the red coat and blue jacket; but by care and avoiding dissipation they manage to weather the ""climate"" for many years. I do not, however, wish to make any invidious comparison between the two classes; there are sober and steady, as there are dissipated and debauched, of each; how, then, is it the trader survives when the officer succumbs? Perhaps he who has escaped from the ""jaws of death"" (as I have done also several times) would say it is the consolatory hope of reaping ""pecuniary benefit."" It is at any rate somewhat strange that the traders who cannot run away from their business every time they are attacked by fever or dysentery should live, when the officer, who generally experiences little difficulty in getting invalided, should die. And I think this fact is a strong argument against those who abuse the traders and say they kill themselves with drink. One of the foremost in the rank of those who revile the traders was a certain ""young man about town,"" who came to ""flame"" in the ""virgin forest,"" ""kiss pretty savages,"" &c., and who experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality at the hands of the traders whom he met.

It is therefore important to find such mischievous exaggerations combated by a medical officer, who writes of West Africa, not from hearsay evidence, but from the experience derived during a residence of twenty-three years in the colony of Sierra Leone and settlements of the Gold Coast. We make these remarks by way of introducing to more general notice the papers above noted, because they supply much valuable and novel information, not only regarding the diseases to which Europeans and natives are subject in West Africa, but because they furnish an interesting description of the topography of Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast.\n\nMr. Clarke is of opinion that the climate of West Africa, if fairly tested, can stand comparison in point of healthfulness with most of our colonies in the East or West Indies, where endemic and epidemic fevers, dysentery, with cholera to boot, prevail quite as frequently and fatally. There are men now in Europe in the enjoyment of fair health who have lived there for periods varying from twenty to twenty-five years. Comparatively, their number is not small, comprehending persons of all classes—governors, civil and military officers, merchants, and missionaries, with their wives and families. He states ""that formerly many officers in the English, Dutch, and Danish service resided upon the Gold Coast, some fourteen, twenty, and thirty years,* and enjoyed good health, although those in subordinate positions had to remove from one station to another."" The fact ought no longer to be concealed, that half at least of the deaths and incapacities which occur amongst Europeans arise from errors of personal economy, and that the mortality lists are unfairly swelled by ascribing to the climate deaths which have been caused by accident or intemperance.\n\nThe following passages may be adduced as proof that the climate is not to blame for everything:—', 'last_edit_date': '1863-05-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_05_1863#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.69, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'CLIMATE OF WESTERN AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I am not singular in believing that healthy Europeans coming to Africa to reside may do so with comparative safety, if they will only take proper precautions to preserve their health.

The West Coast of Africa is not more unwholesome than was that of Western India when I was first stationed there; Bombay, as well as Sierra Leone, was once called the ""White Man\'s Grave.""\n\nYou will object that Captain Cameron and I both suffered from ague and fever during our short stay on the Gold Coast. ""I thought you were fever-proof,"" has been said to me more than once; but a man is never fever-proof in Africa, and rarely cold-proof in England, at least as long as he breathes the upper air. And we gave the climate no chance. New arrivals are advised by all old hands to avoid, for the first three months, over-exertion of mind or body. This, in our case, was equivalent to prescribing a generous diet of beefsteaks and port to a pauper patient. We had to do in twenty-four hours the work of forty-eight; we walked instead of hammocking, the better to collect specimens; and my companion, after a heavy day\'s work, often sat for hours in the dewy night to make his observations. Nor did we stay long enough to become acclimatised. Under other circumstances, we should have passed, at the end of a month or so, through a mild seasoning of ague and fever; and, after the third month, we should have been fit for any amount of exertion. I repeat, that in our case the climate had no fair play.\n\nBut look at things as they are. Of the four English managers of mines, three have retained vigorous health after years of residence on the coast. Only one suffers from rheumatic gout—a complaint certainly not confined to Western Africa. As Mr. Walker told you a few days ago, we all know Englishmen who have lived a score of years, and many more, at Bathurst (Gambia) and at Freetown (Sierra Leone), and who have returned home hale and hearty. I see sundry in this room, as good men as if they had lived in England all their lives.\n\nAnd now, permit me briefly to recapitulate. The good news we bring home is the prodigious wealth of the land; I know nothing to equal it in California or in the Brazils. Gold dust is panned by native women from the sands of the sea shore. Gold spangles glitter after showers in the streets of Axium. Gold is yielded by the lumps of yellow swish that rivet the wattle walls of hut and hovel.

With due care, with proper attention to diet, &c., Tropical Africa is not near so unhealthy as people in England think and say. When a young, strong, healthy man comes to Africa, he ought, for the first couple of years, to be careful of exposure to sun or dew, and of over-fatigue; and his diet should be so moderated as to avoid over-nutrition and stimulation. But, as a general rule, you find new-comers imitating the habits and mode of life of old residents, with the usual result, that they have to go through a course of seasoning fevers. Young men come out, and because they are strong and healthy, they think they can eat or drink anything expose themselves to sun or dew, and shoot all day in swamps with impunity; that, because they see a man of twenty or more years\' experience of the climate bear exposure to the sun for hours without injury to health, they can do the same; that, because the ""old hand"" can eat highly-seasoned food, or use wine and spirits freely, the young hand can do the same. The consequence is, your new-comer has one or more doses of malarious fever, with sundry bilious attacks between times, and, if he survives the ordeal, has to go north to recruit his health, and meanwhile writes pathetic letters to England, complaining of the ""vile climate"" in general, and his own sufferings in particular. In time the neophyte gains experience, becomes willing to learn how to live, and takes care of himself, enjoys better health, and begins to laugh at his former mistakes and fears. As a rule, the longer a man lives in Africa the less frequent and severe attacks of fever become, but every resident will suffer, more or less—sometimes once a year, sometimes twice or more, according to locality and constitution. The longer a man resides in Africa—the average of Europeans—the more he requires nutritious and highly-seasoned food, and a liberal amount of stimulants. Good nutritious food is the requisite, and any liquor that is taken should be good also. Poor food and bad liquor is false economy. As to the teetotal plan, no man, scientist or otherwise, can lay down a dogmatic rule as to what will suit everybody. Men must by experience find out what suits their health best; that is better than all the theories of even medical men. Most of the Europeans I have known in Africa in the past twenty-seven years were men who, as far as they could, lived well. I have known some who lived to excess in eating, and especially in drinking; and they paid the penalty. No advice could affect them; they were deaf and blind to all such. I have known several total abstainers; they used to absorb large quantities of tea or coffee, with the result of frequent attacks of indigestion, which is not likely to improve the general health, and they seemed to suffer as much as any one from climatic fever. Certainly, originally, they were young, strong men, and they mostly weathered through—i.e., did not die—as well as their stimulant-imbibing neighbours; but, as a rule, they were bloodless-looking, debilitated men. One gentleman I knew, who was so rabid an abstainer that he wished he could burn up all the establishments of the merchants in the river where he resided, so as to prevent the importation of what he called the ""Devil\'s fluid,"" yet I found that he suffered from fever more than any other man in that river, and was not near so active. Next to general care of health, diet, &c., comes occupation. Constant work for mind and body is essential to good health. Your busy man seldom suffers so much in health as your semi-idle, or wholly idle man. At places where the British flag flies, on the West Coast, the civil and military officers—especially the latter—are, as a rule, much more sickly than members of the mercantile community. The civil officers are employed only a portion of the day at work that is so routine, that it does not sufficiently engage the mind and rouse the latent energies. Military men have hardly anything to do beyond attending parade, standing guard in turn, and doing a little regimental routine correspondence; they suffer from the climate badly. Both the above classes of men, of course, live well, but have not such employment as would enable them to assimilate nutriment in the easiest and most beneficial manner. Commercial men often work from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., enjoy much better health, and, from the active nature of their life, both mentally and physically, benefit fully by liberal living.', 'last_edit_date': '1882-08-05', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_10_1882#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.669, 'probability_score': 0.065, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'In the Government Blue-book relative to the comparative health, &c., of seamen employed on various stations throughout the world there is the following relative to the climate of the West Coast, by Assistant-Surgeon J. Lambert, of the Espoir, which confirms the statements we have always made on the subject: ""I do not think the Coast, either ashore or afloat, nearly so unhealthy as it is constantly represented to be. On shore, from the little I have seen of it, Englishmen act very much as if they were at home, and indeed sometimes much more loosely; they smoke and imbibe alcoholic stimulants too much, and indulge especially in other forms of dissipation, which are all debilitating causes, preparing the way for the inroads of malaria. They do not look on themselves as belonging to another clime, and requiring special care and great attention to all those hygienic rules which apply with greater or less force wherever our race wanders, be it in the healthiest places possible, so far as external agencies are concerned, but which apply with especial force where, as here, many of the surrounding agencies are inimical to a healthy action of the animal functions. With temperance in diet, stimulants, and, generally, personal cleanliness as well as surrounding cleanliness, a free interchange of air in dormitories, exercise in the open air, and a moderate exposure to the sun, I think Europeans, fully grown and with sound constitutions, could remain many years on the Coast, and return to Europe without much impairment of health. This would be very much more true could merchants choose their trading stations. For obvious reasons at present the mouths of the rivers are chosen, which above all are the most unhealthy places, especially as in many cases pure water cannot be had, and river water, often impure, is used for all purposes. Afloat, with little communication with the shore, no general leave at notoriously unhealthy places, using distilled water, or good spring water when it can be had without exposing the men to too much fatigue or malaria, avoiding river waters, and rarely entering them; a free use of quinine when required; doing away with boat cruising, more berthing accommodation, a liberal supply of fresh beef and vegetables, allowing the men to buy stock at the various places, less drill aloft, great attention to personal cleanliness and the general cleanliness of the ship, I feel sure, putting aside the so-called infectious epidemics, which ought rarely to occur, the health of the cruisers would be as good as on any station, and better than on many.""', 'last_edit_date': '1869-04-23', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/23_04_1869#article-17', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.67, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'Climate of the West Coast of Africa', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'But, as a rule, the most healthy, because the most industrious, of white residents in Western Africa, including the Gold Coast, are Englishmen, Americans, Germans, and Dutchmen.

Burton, has told us that last year, when surveying the Akankoo concession, he worked for days together up to his middle in water, and lived! Captain Burton himself, in a letter written in February last to the directors of the Guinea Coast Gold Mining Company, speaking of Apollonia, says ""During the hot hours the doctor—that is, the sea breeze—blows freshly; the evening temperature is delicious, and during the cool dewy nights we found blankets necessary.""\n\nI visited all the mines then being worked, and saw upwards of thirty Europeans, of various nationalities, who both worked and lived. I also saw very large numbers of natives, as well as several hundreds of Kroomen, who worked regularly, both day and night, at the mines, and in transporting heavy machinery and other goods from Axim to the different mines at and near Takwah. I travelled partly by hammock, partly by boat and canoe, as well as on foot, over Wassaw, Egwira, Apollonia, Axim, and Apatim, meeting hundreds of native carriers transporting provisions, pieces of heavy machinery, and other articles, by road and river, without overseers, and by whose means, aided by Kroomen, everything now at the mines had been carried there, with little loss by accident or theft. I slept in native huts without doors or fastenings; and at Axim, my bedroom door and windows remained open day and night; yet the whole extent of my loss by theft, during six months, was one plated table-fork stolen on board a steam launch! Surely this does not look as though the ""natives cannot be induced to work,"" or that ""the people are debased beyond conception."" On the contrary, having visited most places between Gorée and the Congo, I am happy to state that I found the natives of the Western Province of the Gold Coast Colony exceptionally honest for negroes. As to work, we all know that the negro has no abstract love of labour, but he can and will work for gain—and work well. Moreover whenever it may become necessary, Coolies in any number can be imported from China and India, and this is already under consideration.\n\nRoads can be made, and kept in order, where the traffic is sufficiently great to counteract the rapidity of vegetable growth incidental to a tropical climate; and here again I may quote Captain Burton\'s letter, in which he says: ""A good line was cut from the village to the concession.

A. Nealon, late medical officer to the Akankoo Gold Mining Company, which appeared in our contemporary, *The Mining Journal*: Europeans going abroad to the tropics will do well to remember that their mode of living there must be very different to what it has been at home. Very few know how to adapt themselves to the circumstances of a tropical climate, and to this fact I believe a good deal of the illness and many of the deaths on the West Coast of Africa are due. Most Anglo-Africans bring with them the idea that the climate is exhausting, and that they must make up for loss of energy by eating. They eat more meat, and a greater number of times, than they do in England. At home the working man has to be content in the majority of cases with one meat meal daily. In Africa he must have three, because a company finds him in food. Three meat meals at home, with insufficient exercise, would soon produce deleterious effects, yet men expect to do the same in Africa, and with impunity. I have no hesitation in saying that most of the cases of fever I have seen were due to excessive meat eating, and to wilful disobedience of medical orders. With regard to alcohol, I have not seen its use in moderation attended with any evil results. Of total abstinence I cannot speak, as I have never known a total abstainer on the Coast. As to the particular kind of alcohol, most medical men with Coast experience agree that good whisky, well diluted, is the safest and best. Claret for working men I strongly object to. All cheap clarets are very acid, and taken in quantity, soon impair digestion. Lager beer is preferable if alcohol is to be given. The objection to withholding alcohol *in toto* is that men will then secretly buy trade gin and get drunk on it, as I have known more than once. On the abuse of alcohol it is unnecessary to dwell. The fact that three-fourths of the deaths on the Coast are due to it speaks for itself. When travelling cold tea is the best drink to quench the thirst, which must of necessity arise. Alcohol only intensifies the thirst, and requires frequent repetition if once used. Europeans newly arrived are more susceptible to malaria than those longer resident. But no length of residence on the West Coast will give complete immunity from fevers, though it may lessen the attacks. Bearing this in mind, all will do well to adopt ordinary precautions, of which the following are the most important:\n\n1. Avoid undue exposure in the early morning, while the fog still hangs on the ground; during the heat of the day; and after sunset, when the dew begins to fall. A light repast (biscuit and tea or coffee) should be taken before leaving the house.\n\n2.

It is generally agreed that this is to be attributed to our superior mode of living, for the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Frenchmen are generally as hardy and as strong as we are.\n\nThe Chairman advised Europeans to adopt a diet of ""rice, weak tea, and mild tobacco."" Well, any white man who went in for such a diet should be either made of cast iron—if such a being could be manufactured—or else must be an idiotic candidate for a suicide\'s grave. Why, Kroomen cannot exist continually on rice; their diet has to be changed, in their own country, to corn, and, in factories down the Coast, to biscuit, with a free allowance of beef. A twelvemonth\'s diet of rice produces in most Kroomen valvular disease of the heart, with dropsy of the extremities and abdomen, and if the case is not treated at once, on the first signs of swelling in the feet, by change of diet, with medicine, death follows in a few days. Perhaps the Chairman can stand a diet that will kill a Krooman?\n\nWith regard to longevity of life in Africa, and the time a man can stay out without change of climate, much depends on where he resides. In Gambia, men have resided seven years at a time without leaving the place. On the Southwest Coast, men like Mr. Walker have resided three or more years without going to Europe or Madeira; while in the Bights three years is a long spell—eighteen months to two years being about the average time. Then a man, if he is even not very ill, feels the climate has so tried him that a few months\' change to the north is absolutely necessary. The same rule applies to the Gold, Ivory, and Grain Coasts.

Even the wearing of African dress was banned or discouraged in certain areas and those educated people who insisted on wearing African clothes were branded as having 'gone native'. Throughout the colonial period, therefore, African art, music, dancing and even history were all not only ignored but even positively discouraged or denied. Those were the days when Professor A. P. Newton could write 'Africa has practically no history before the coming of Europeans ...

Exactly how much is anybody's guess. The effect of colonial African experience with American blacks appears, nevertheless, unique and vital in terms of subsequent social and political activities. For some, the American black component within African nationalist ideology and strategies emerging during the colonial period was striking and unequivocal. In the view of others, for example some African students, interactions within American black arenas were disappointing and unrewarding. The caustic assessment of one such visitor illustrates the latter point: 'One of the things I had decided to find out during my stay in America was the condition of the descendants of former slaves brought here from Africa ... I feel safe in saying that, so far as economic and material progress are concerned the Negro in America is on the average ahead of the West African, but when it comes to integrity and genuine manhood, the American Negro is far below him.' 75 Another view was that many Afro-American missionaries who viewed Africans as 'poor heathen savages' must bear some of the responsibility for perpetuating a distorted and pernicious picture of Africa and Africans in the minds of their fellow American blacks. In other words, in their sedulous campaign to recruit American black workers for foreign missions, missionary churches undoubtedly succumbed occasionally to the tempta- tion of portraying an exotic, erotic and socially inferior Africa much in need of great sacrifice, hard work, and alien redemption."", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.638, 'probability_score': 0.05, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African diaspora', 'section_title': 'The impact of Africa', 'content': 'Where they could - and where they had no other recourse - Africans and Afro-Americans adjusted to the conditions in which they found them› selves.

Cre› ativity became especially necessary where a small number of Europeans lived among a large number of Africans as was the case in many colonies of exploitation such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Saint-Domingue.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ...

The whole region underwent ecological stress resulting in drought with consequent famines. Rinderpest epidemics also occurred. 6 Again, some societies were affected by these natural calamities more deeply than others.

In fact, if your readers would carefully and candidly examine that article, they will soon discover ""Progress\'s"" drift as he there demonstrates. I am aware that ""success makes enemies,"" for I cannot see what else could have actuated ""Progress."" The conclusion I have drawn in reading that article is, that ""Progress"" had had a malicious feeling against me, and, for aught I know, he had tried all his best to cause my destruction, but did not succeed, so now he is led to reveal himself. 1st, he states that ""it is better to probe an ulcer before putting medicine, than to cover it with plaster and tell the patient to be of good cheer."" Let me ask, what reference has that to do with the school in question? Did he allow jealousy, covetousness, and envy to make a sore in his heart, and did not probe it long ago, but covered it with plaster by writing to the public, and cheered himself that, should an article appear against me, I should be expelled from my situation, and my salary, of which he speaks so highly, be given to him? If so, the public can see whether he has succeeded, and obtained the peace he dreamed of obtaining. 2ndly, he speaks of Vesuvius and Etna belching out ashes and lava, &c. Let me ask, if Vesuvius and Etna could belch out ashes and lava, what has he belched before the public but gross ignorance; or why has he allowed himself to remain in a semi-civilized state, as he says he is? 3rdly, he states that ""anarchy, oppression, and ignorance seldom fail to produce revolution."" Poor fellow! has he been oppressed, and has he thought me to be such a governor or king who is not amenable to a judicature? And what a coward he is, writing against a schoolmaster, whose ability, he says, is small! and still he is afraid to subscribe his name. And I am quite sure, if he writes two millions of anonymous letters, the Primitive Methodist Society will not pay the least regard to them. 4thly, he states, ""Instead of the cleanliness that characterized the children, they are now going with uncombed hair, untidy dress,"" &c. If that is true (which I don\'t say it is), what a shame! Could the people here have requested him to write and tell the public that formerly they sent their children to school with combed hair, tidy dress, &c., but now it is the reverse, and it is the fault of the schoolmaster? I must leave it to the judgment of the public. 5thly, ""the day-school scholars, when tried, are unequal to the Sabbath-school scholars.""

With regard to the alleged outrages by missionaries on natives of Africa, that is, by members of the Blantyre mission, to which Dr. Cameron called the particular attention of the House of Commons—outrages of which, he said, the missionaries confessed they had been guilty, but which they attempted to justify—we must say that we agree with Mr. J. Campbell, that while a hasty judgment ought not to be passed, there cannot be a shadow of doubt that it is wrong for missionaries to assume criminal jurisdiction over the natives of uncivilized countries. The Blantyre missionaries, like all other ministers of Protestant missions, are supposed to have gone forth among the heathen to proclaim the glad tidings of salvation, and to preach the Gospel of peace and love, not to administer human justice, and to shoot and flog offenders to death. In that the Blantyre missionaries have admitted (if it be so) ""that collisions with the natives had taken place, and lives had been lost in their attempts to establish criminal jurisdiction,"" they certainly have thus condemned themselves as missionaries; and the sooner the mission is withdrawn from the field in which it has thus departed from the legitimate sphere of missionary action the better. But we are, nevertheless, far from thinking that the Blantyre missionaries, however much they may have erred as missionaries, have made themselves amenable to the provisions of the 24th and 25th Victoria, c. 100, sec. 9, as having committed the crimes of murder and manslaughter contemplated by that Act of Parliament; and still less can we agree with Dr. Cameron in his contention ""that whenever uncivilized people need chastisement, that chastisement shall only be inflicted by authorised persons, and that no traveller should be allowed to take upon himself the power of life and death."" By ""authorised persons"" Dr. Cameron evidently meant persons holding powers of jurisdiction under the British Crown, or under some other civilized power than that of Great Britain; and he seemed to think that the strongest application of such law to British subjects would facilitate ""the march of exploration and research."" Traders, travellers, and explorers in uncivilized countries may be truly said to carry their lives in their hands. They are always warned that from the moment they pass beyond the boundaries of countries over which the jurisdiction of civilized powers extend, they do so at their own risk and peril. They are, in fact, thrown upon their own resources for their own protection; and as a general rule it will be found that if they commit acts of violence, except in strict self-defence, they themselves perish as a consequence of that violence. It has been held, as a general principle of British and all civilized law, that responsibility goes with protection, but does not extend beyond the limits of protection; and although there has been an attempt to extend responsibility beyond the limits of protection, as under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 41, 2 Vic. c. 67, alluded to by Sir C. Dilke, which gives power to issue an order in Council for the exercise of British jurisdiction over British subjects abroad, Her Majesty\'s Government has never seen fit to use the powers given under that Act; nor will they, we think, ever see fit to exercise it so as to take from travellers and explorers in uncivilized countries the right of self-defence against the attacks of savages whose countries they may be traversing. To take from them this right—to lay down as a rule of law that if they cause the death of one or more savages in self-defence they have been guilty of the crime of murder, punishable by death under British law, would be to put an end to exploration in uncivilized countries altogether, instead of facilitating it, as Dr. Cameron seemed inclined to contend. No one can deprecate acts of violence more than we do—in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they are as unnecessary as they are unchristian; but if we are asked whether we had rather that the great discovery of the source of the River Congo should never have been made, than that the lives of a certain number of opposing cannibals, clamorous for human flesh, should have been sacrificed by Stanley in forcing his way down that great stream, the knowledge of the true course and importance of which may lead to the redemption of extensive countries from loathsome barbarism by the diffusion of Christianity and civilization among their inhabitants, we are in conscience compelled to admit that, although we deplore that any human life, whether of the explorers or their opponents, should have been sacrificed in the course of that great discovery, we hold that sacrifice to have been insignificant and unworthy of notice in view of the enormous results that may, and will, accrue from that discovery. Even the most patient and Christian of all known explorers in Africa, the lamented Dr. Livingstone, did not deprecate the use of violence in cases of necessity, and thought it well that the English should be known as people who can hit hard when unjustly attacked. Either we must condemn the whole of those vast interior countries of Africa to unmitigated barbarism for yet a long succession of ages, or we must be prepared for occasional acts of violence in self-defence on the part of travellers and explorers. With all respect to Dr. Cameron, nothing can, in our opinion, be more ridiculous than to lay down as a rule that whenever uncivilized people need chastisement it should be inflicted by authorised persons. If Stanley had given up himself and his followers, for whose life and well-being he was responsible, unresistingly into the hands of the cannibals of the Congo, and he and they had been eaten accordingly, does Dr. Cameron pretend to believe that, in the improbable event of the news that Stanley and his people had been cooked and eaten having ever reached this country, the British Government would have fitted out an expedition to chastise those wretchedly uncivilized people? The idea is absurd. We should have been told that before Stanley undertook such an expedition he should have counted the cost; that he had thrust himself into danger without adequate means of self-defence, and had paid the penalty of his rashness. We think Dr. Cameron did well to bring before the House the alleged exercise of criminal jurisdiction by the Blantyre missionaries, who were not sent forth for purposes of exploration or discovery, or to found a colony, but simply to endeavour to propagate the truths and doctrines of Christianity. We have no desire to see Protestant missionaries following the course of the Jesuit missions to Paraguay and elsewhere. If it be indispensable to the establishment and maintenance of a mission station in East Central Africa, that the missionaries should do such things as the Blantyre missionaries are stated to have done, and to have admitted that they have done, it only makes good the opinion we have at all times expressed, that there can be no satisfactory missionary establishments among the heathen, except where there is a basis of British Power; and that British missionary efforts among the heathen can only be safely or beneficially undertaken where there is such a basis of power. The uncivilized Africans, like, and perhaps even more than, all other uncivilized people, believe only in ""power."" They have no respect for anything but power. They do not understand or believe in generosity or forbearance; these they look upon as evidence of weakness, which they despise; and we sincerely believe that...\n91'}]","[{'document_title': 'MR.

Taking a bird's-eye view of the whole situation in time and space, so that each factor might assume its proper relative position and proportion, he unhesitatingly affirmed in the plainest language that so far their intercourse with African races, instead of being a blessing, had been little better than an unmitigated curse to them.

This work by a native African ought to do much to rehabilitate in European estimation the race to which he belongs.

After having vindicated the Africans from the stigma of natural inferiority endeavoured to be fixed upon them by anthropologists and others, the author passes in interesting and instructive review the republic of Liberia, the various British settlements from the River Gambia to Lagos inclusive, and the native races beyond in Dahomey, the Yoruba country, the Niger, and Oil River countries.

There are thousands of native Africans who are in all respects the equals of the most cultured Europeans; and the average West African is not deficient in those qualities the need of which would prevent his governing himself; but subject to the shocking influences which are all around, is it to be wondered at that he sinks to a lower level than his entirely uncivilised neighbour in the far interior?', 'last_edit_date': '1891-03-02', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/02_03_1891#article-7', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.6, 'probability_score': 0.066, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The Relation between the Mohammedan Tribes of Africa and the Christians', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Professor Blyden (interviewed in the United States), says the *African Repository*, when asked ""What is the relation between the native Mohammedan tribes of Africa and the Christians?"" replied: ""Christianity has not had a fair chance in Africa. In the first place, missionary operations have been confined to the unhealthy districts adjacent to the seaboard, and under such circumstances the efforts of the missionaries have been irregular. Men cannot do justice to their work when they are continually sailing. Again, the natives among whom the missionaries have laboured have also come into contact with European traders—Christians they claim to be—and practices have presented such a flagrant contrast to the teachings of the missionaries that what little good the latter have been able to accomplish in the face of the obstacles with which they have had to contend has been more than counterbalanced by the mischief wrought by the former. The children who attend the missionary schools are, as a rule, the children of the lower class of natives, and their home influences are not of a character favourable to the growth of Christian precepts. The Mohammedans on the other hand, coming from the east and north, belong to what you may call a cognate race to the negro. They are already acclimatized; they settle in negro towns, intermarry with the people and entirely amalgamate with them. By this means they come in contact with a better class of people and their influence is regular and continuous. The Arab traders do not bring with them the demoralizing commodities which form a large part of the stock in trade of the European traders. Hence travellers in Africa along the coast find that the negroes who are Mohammedans give greater evidence of self-respect and self-reliance than do most of those negroes who are Christians. It is a very serious and by no means agreeable contrast for the Christian world to contemplate. The Mohammedans everywhere strenuously oppose the introduction of ardent spirits into the country. If it were not for them, intoxicating liquors would have wrought fearful havoc among the native tribes."" We regret that Mr. Blyden kept out of sight the demoralizing influences of Mohammedanism which have been so fatal in many parts of Africa. Mohammedan civilization! where it prevails, may be a seeming blessing to a few, but is a scourge and a degradation for the many; and in view of the horrible slave trade carried on by Mohammedans in Africa, we cannot imagine an enlightened African looking upon Mohammedanism as anything short of a curse to Africa.—Ed. *A.T.*', 'last_edit_date': '1882-11-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_11_1882#article-5', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.63, 'probability_score': 0.068, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'BRITISH MISRULE IN WEST AFRICA.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'Under this heading there has lately appeared in the London Daily Graphic a series of illustrated articles, tending to show how demoralizing to the Native mind is much that arises from the present system of British rule and influence in this part of the world. It is now more than a century since Sierra Leone was founded, to be a centre of light and civilisation for the whole West Coast of Africa; and it must be admitted by every one who has made a study of this matter, that so far this purpose has not been achieved. When we look to India and Australia we are struck with wonder at the marvellous material and moral progress which is the outcome of a century of British rule. But with Africa—the West Coast especially—the result is far different; in spite of the great extension of European influence in that portion of the world, it is doubtful whether the Native, quâ Native, is really the better for what has been brought before him during the last hundred years. Not that it is his fault; at least, entirely. When Great Britain set herself to the task of redeeming the great debt which she, above all nations, owed to Africa—for was not she the originator of the shameful Slave Trade?—she was prompted doubtless by the best of motives, but did not fully appreciate the difficulties of the task she then undertook. To repair the wrong she herself had inflicted there was but one sure course—to devote her best. The history of the past century is one long catalogue of failures in this respect, and the result is made manifest now, when we see the Native West African brought down by the drink traffic to a level lower than that of those who have not been affected by the so-called civilisation.\n\nSpeaking of the demoralizing effect of the unchecked drink traffic, Mr. F. Buxton, in the Daily Graphic, draws a sharp contrast between the present moral and social state of the Natives in the French colony of the Gaboon and what he saw at Freetown.

Liberia has been a black republic for forty years; Sierra Leone has been a negro colony for a century; and it cannot be denied that each of these communities has made very gratifying progress. Yet, upon Dr. Blyden's own showing, that progress has been but partial, he still has to complain of his countrymen's imitativeness and lack of backbone. The responsibility for this, undoubtedly, rests to some extent upon the unsuitable character of the education which the civilized negroes have received; but it is more to the purpose to remember that three generations is a very brief period in the development of a pagan people. How slow the work of civilization in Liberia has been may be seen from the fact that, whereas there are some twenty thousand Christian negroes in the republic, there are more than a million who are pagans. And now we inevitably come to the primary question of all: whether or not the presumed racial inferiority of the negro is proved. Dr. Blyden pleads eloquently for his fellows, and triumphantly asks: How could an inferior race have produced Toussaint L'Ouverture? The question is not unnatural, but it is far from logical. The matter, as it fashions itself to us, is, and is likely to remain for a long time to come, an open one. The negro has, as yet, enjoyed no sufficient opportunity of proving either his mental equality with or his inferiority to the white. The experience of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so far as it has gone, has been in his favour; what we know of his moral history in that other black republic, Hayti, and in the United States, is at the best negative. As time goes on, the question, which is far more momentous than would appear to the unthinking, will settle itself. Emigration from America to Liberia, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, is proceeding satisfactorily; and Dr. Blyden states that 200,000 negroes in the United States are prepared to return to the land of their fathers. But colonization by private effort is, at the best, exceedingly slow; and in this instance it is perhaps well that it is so, since the gradual settlement of Liberia is far more likely to provide material for a strong and healthy State than a hasty rush would be. Social reformers for many a year to come will watch the experiment, as they have watched it in the past, with keen interest. The chief danger lies, as Dr. Blyden constantly points out, in the tendency to Europeanize the negro—to supersede customs and practices which are useful and often necessary in Africa by customs utterly out of place there. The ill-directed zeal of some of the less reflective missionaries has, no doubt, been to blame for some of this; but there is, we fancy, very little to complain of upon this head now. Let it be once proved beyond all doubt that negroes can found flourishing colonies, can develop the limitless resources of the continent which has been the cradle of their race; and, above all, that they can govern themselves prudently and self-reliantly,—and there will open up before the black man the assurance of a future as splendid and far-reaching as any that ever presented itself to a white conqueror."", 'last_edit_date': '1887-09-01', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_09_1887#article-6', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.608, 'probability_score': 0.067, 'summary': []}, {'document_title': 'The African Times.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'At the present time, from all parts of the West African coast, we have reports of troubles and disturbances, which must hamper trade and retard the commercial and civilising development of that part of the Dark Continent.

It is much to be hoped that this is the case, for at the present time trade needs fostering on the West Coast more than perhaps ever before, and this object can only be attained by the cheerful co-operation of all interested in its maintenance. The British administration in West Africa has been by no means free from faults in the past; and these faults have born their natural fruit. The secret of good Colonial government would seem to consist in interfering as little as possible with Native customs and prejudices, but at the same time making it thoroughly understood that laws and ordinances must be respected. Now that the dispute with the Jebus and Egbas would seem to be in a fair way of settlement, it affords an opportunity to the Governor of Lagos to insure that, though these tribes are to be treated fairly and with patience, they must quite understand that any infraction of the engagements now or subsequently undertaken by them, will be visited most severely upon the offenders.\n\nBut the troubles in this part of the world are by no means confined to the British.

While in the Dutch and English factories, where hundreds of negroes are employed, all commands are quietly given and as quietly obeyed. The Latin races, French and Portuguese, have constant resource to the whip. The difference rests in the better understanding of the negro character possessed by the Germanic races. They treat the negroes with strict justice, and do not look upon them as mere black animals, nor as the plaything of the moment\'s humour. ""The longer my stay on the Lower Congo,"" says Zinkgraf, ""the sadder was the impression I received in seeing those Europeans using the whip every moment, and behaving in a truly brutal manner. Blows and kicks and whippings I have seen often enough. And yet the men who practise such cruelties could be most amiable and attentive to their white brethren, and were always, as one says, gentlemanlike. In their excuse they were accustomed to say that such treatment of the negroes was in harmony with the views of Congo society, and that a lengthened residence on the coast rendered the nerves of Europeans so irritable that it was difficult to maintain self-command when dealing with a race so low in the scale of humanity as the Congo negroes. It will be the chief task of the Etat Independent du Congo to decree laws that will fix the social position of the negro, and protect him against the rude excesses of his masters.

Dr. Blyden says that the European languages ""have come to the greater portion of the natives associated with profligacy, plunder, and cruelty, and devoid of any connexion with spiritual things; while the Arabic is regarded by them as the language of prayer and devotion, of religion and piety, of all that is unworldly and spiritual.""
