HH: The formation of the Fanti Confederation was a response to external pressures and conflicts, particularly involving European powers.

It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat). He was arrested by ruse in 1896 at the time of the rush for colonial territory and deported.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.621, 'probability_score': 0.05}

At the other extreme, it is possible to envisage cases where the indigenous rulers adopted reactionary attitudes, where attempts were made to maintain incomes by predatory means, and where internal conflicts were pro› nounced. In these cases an explanation of imperialism will need to place more weight on disintegrative forces on the African side of the frontier, though without neglecting external factors. 32 The present writer agrees with most of the views of members of this school.$^{33}$ Like them, he explains the partition in both African and European terms, and therefore sees the African dimension theory as supplementing the Eurocentric theories already discussed. He sees the partition and con› quest as the logical consequence of European nibbling at Africa which started well before the nineteenth century; he accepts that the essentially economic impulse that necessitated that nibbling changed drastically during the last quarter of the nineteenth century; that the change was caused by the transition from slave to legitimate trade and the subsequent decline in both the export and import trade during that period, and that it was this economic change in Africa and the consequent African resistance to increasing European influence that precipitated the actual military con› quest.

Holland Rose, by 'a state of political equilibrium which made for peace and stagnation in Europe',$^{58}$ the same period in Africa was marked by inter-state and intra-state conflict and rivalry - the Mandingo against the Tukulor, the Asante against the Fante, the Baganda against the Banyoro, the Batoro against the Banyoro, the Mashona against the Ndebele, etc. Thus, while Europe could focus her attention militarily almost exclusively on her imperial activities overseas without any distraction at home, African states and countries had their attention divided. Moreover, in addition to enjoying peace at home, however divided the European powers were on imperial and colonial issues, throughout the era of partition and up to 1914 they always managed to resolve these questions without resort to war. Thus, in spite of the intense competition and the numerous crises in Africa, the European powers involved in the partition displayed a remarkable spirit of solidarity which not only elimi› nated wars among them but also prevented the African rulers and com› munities from effectively playing one European power against the other. Throughout the period under review, various European powers took on the African states one at a time, and on no occasion was an African state assisted by one European power against another.\nBy contrast, the behaviour of the African states was not only marked by lack of solidarity, unity or co-operation but some of them did not hesitate to ally with the invading European forces against their neighbours, only to be vanquished later themselves. The Baganda allied with the British against the Banyoro, and the Barotse with the British against the Ndebele, while the Bambara teamed up with the French against the Tukulor.$^{59}$ As a result of all this, the heroic and memorable stands which the Africans took against the European invaders were - as will be seen in subsequent chapters$^{60}$ - more often than not, isolated forms of uncoordinated resist› ance, even at the regional level.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.626, 'probability_score': 0.05}

European statesmen averted this crisis in power politics and drew back. Power politics from that point on to the Bosnian crisis of 1908 were removed from Europe and played out in Africa and Asia.

African leaders had no answer to this strategy. The competition for power in Africa had been drawn into the international politics of the Concert of Europe where African diplomatic skills were at a grave disadvantage. It is doubtful whether African leaders realized until too late how great was the danger that threatened them. They were used to thinking that the European base was far away and that, in the final analysis, they had the advantage of numbers.\nThey continued to act as if they could play off one European power against another. In South Africa, they even believed that they could appeal to the Queen of England and her direct representatives to carry out treaty obligations against the wishes of Anglo-Boer settlers and fortune seekers. Far from any notion of forging a pan-African solidarity similar to that pursued by the Europeans, each African state acted as seemed best in its own individual interest.\nIt appears that, if any factor is to be singled out, the basic explanation for this was to be found not only in the diplomatic abilities of the European strategists, but also in the legacy of wars that was part of the revolutionary situation of nineteenth-century Africa. It was the intensity of the rivalries and the bitterness of the wars that made African rulers slow to realize that tackling the European threat should have taken precedence over their inter› state rivalries, and that they should have united to face it.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.617, 'probability_score': 0.05}

But because a sphere of influence was a political rather than a legal notion, a friendly power might choose to respect this fact while an unfriendly power might choose to ignore it. The same was true of the hinterland doctrine, notorious for its evocation of the principle of 'manifest destiny' and the wild claims made on its behalf. Both doctrines, in short, had no legitimacy in international law.$^{54}$ 'The modern doctrine of Hinterland', Salisbury observed in 1896, 'with its inevitable contradictions, indicates the un› informed and unstable condition of international law as applied to territorial claims resting on constructive occupation or control.'$^{55}$ In other words, 'a claim of sovereignty in Africa can only be maintained by real occupation of the territory claimed'.$^{56}$ And since the notion of effective occupation with which the vast majority of the African states were unfamiliar - and the African notion of the real meaning of these treaty relations with Euro› peans were in fundamental contradiction with one another, the situation of conflict was bound to be intensified.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the "Dark Continent" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role. Thus, while he sees Anglo-Saxon imperialism as economic and philanthropic, that of France is seen as being motivated by prestige. 22 With respect to the global strategy', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.607, 'probability_score': 0.049}

'Refusals to annex', it has been remarked perceptively, 'are no proof of reluctance to control'.$^{34}$ This explains both the attitudes of Salisbury and Bismarck and indeed of most of the major actors in the partition.\nBut this attitude began to change as a result of three major events which occurred between 1876 and 1880. The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

Yet the modifications and new perspectives enlarge rather than controvert the three basic propositions I have been discussing.

Exploration of the ideological basis of resistance gains a new richness when we add the first manifestations of 'consciousness' on the part of workers or peasants to the idea of sovereignty and to the search for a new moral order. And the exploration of the links between resistance and the present situation of Africa gains a new resonance from the idea of economic resist› ance.

Initially, market considerations were the most decisive factor. As production grew in the Maghrib to keep pace with the rate of industrialization in Europe, prices fell accordingly and the terms of trade deteriorated. Under the harsh economic conditions of the times, competition became progressively fiercer and European policies for expansion overseas became more aggressive. 15 As early as 1816, the British fleet under Lord Exmouth was despatched to North Africa and this was repeated in 1819 under Admiral Freemantle with the co-operation of the French naval division of Admiral Jurien, in order to notify the 'Barbary' powers of the ban that had been placed on privateering by a concerted decision of the European nations. This osten› sibly noble purpose, however, concealed rapacious intentions, since sub› stantial commercial privileges were demanded by the French, especially on behalf of their countrymen living in Provence, and by the British on behalf of their Italian and Spanish clients, who were in competition with the French.

By 1827 they were no longer refusing the foreign consuls anything and by degrees fell into line with their policy. The first one-sided treaties imposed on trióse countries reflected the special nature of the relations of Tunis and Tripoli with the European powers.

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training.

But for reasons to be discussed later, the British had killed this bold and interesting initiative stone-dead by 1873. 59 A similar constitutional experiment was that of the Egba United Board of Management formed at Abeokuta.

It was the last gasp of protest on the Gold Coast against creeping colon› ialism. It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

In various places, missionaries seeking converts often received a warm welcome from African rulers who, although very jealous of their inde- pendence and not keen to have their people converted, saw in missionary activities a possible access route to European education which might teach literacy and technical skills such as carpentry, printing and, if possible, also the manufacture of guns and gunpowder. The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.661, 'probability_score': 0.05}

Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity. 'The shift in primordial loyalties repre› sented a new level of political consciousness in which the Portuguese were perceived for the first time as the common oppressor.' 20", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.664, 'probability_score': 0.05}

Destroy him.' 14 The idea of sovereignty clearly did provide an ideology for resistance. Nevertheless, important modifications must be made. Rulers were not always very clearly 'guardians of the sovereignty of the people'. In nineteenth-century Africa - in the west, east and south - new states had arisen, based on 'the military technology of Europe'. '$^{5}$ Such states often resisted the direct extension of European power but their resistance was undermined by the disaffection of many of their subjects. Thornton tells us of West African states like those of Samori Ture or of Shehu Ahmadu that 'they were burdened by constant revolts caused mainly by their high› handed and exploitative state structures ... by and large the leadership of the states, exploitative and tyrannical as they were, did not possess the legitimacy to go to the country and carry on the wars'.

Such a situation obviously did not lend itself to an ongoing and unified effort' against the whites. 17 States such as these may be contrasted with longer-established polities in which the rulers had achieved 'legitimacy'. But even here it would be over-romantic to suppose that all ancient aristocracies enjoyed popular trust and support.

The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.658, 'probability_score': 0.049}


HH: The Fanti Confederation played a significant role in regional diplomacy and conflict resolution.

The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate. Above all, however, the British did their utmost to repress intellectuals and divide the chiefs until the Fante Confederation collapsed.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.691, 'probability_score': 0.052}

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

He had a twofold objective: to keep Asante at bay and to bring the coastal peoples under his control. He therefore had a tripartite FanteBritish-Asante treaty signed whereby the parties recognized the inde› pendence of the coastal countries south of the Pra river, agreed to bring any conflict before the British party and undertook to keep trade routes open.

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.645, 'probability_score': 0.05}

They also supplied, in the form of tribute, a large part of the manpower used in Asante wars and agriculture.$^{13}$ This significant distinction has been contested on the grounds that economic and political motivations existed in all the Asante wars. In a similar vein, references have been made to the presence of Asante representatives in all types of states and also to the introduction of substantial Asante features into the Dagomba army or interventions by the Asantehene in Gonja and Dagomba succession disputes. 14 It is obvious nevertheless that the mandates of the Asante regional commissioners varied according to the situation.

There were the aggressive militarist-offensive states. The Zulu, Ndebele and Gaza kingdoms appear to have been fairly good examples of this genre. To this group may also be added the various Nguni states of the transZambezi region. These states, which employed the military machine to conquer and subdue others, tended also to rely on the edge of the sword or the barrel of the gun to maintain the allegiance of subordinate polities. Their expansionist or imperialistic policies required that they keep pro› fessional or semi-professional armies on a permanent basis in 'barracks' or military villages. Regiments were required to embark on regular tax- or tribute-gathering expeditions at outlying parts of the kingdom. These armies were built on the age-regiments, which in the Ndebele and Zulu cases were the essential instruments for the absorption of conquered youths. The Gaza state did enrol conquered youths in age-regiments but kept these segregated from those of the 'Nguni' youths, even though the regimental leaders were drawn from the conquering ruling group. Thus in the Gaza state, the regiments did not contribute to building national unity. Because of the blatant discrimination against the 'ba-Tshangane', as the conquered Tsonga were called, they were not assimilated into the Gaza state.

HH: The Fanti Confederation's recognition by British authorities indicates a shift in colonial policy towards accommodating indigenous political structures.

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.667, 'probability_score': 0.051}

As at no other time or in any other continent subjected to European domination, colonial policy came to be referred to as 'native policy'. Granted that the term supported a variety of definitions in the administration of'natives', the word generally employed in describing Africans, there was general agreement both in theory and in practice that colonial rule could only be effectively secured through the use of indigenous personnel and institutions in some complementary or supportive function.\nThis realization was the result of the colonial situation already deter› mined by those nineteenth-century Europeans who had been operating in Africa. With Algeria and Southern Africa listed as the notable excep› tions, the vast land mass of the continent was considered climatically in› hospitable to intensive white settlement, while the local populations appeared to be insufficiently concentrated geographically to allow for effective direct administration by European personnel. Essentially, Africa was deemed to be a congeries of tropical estates whose populations were to be both enlisted and directed by the Europeans for externally defined purposes. What Sir Frederick (later Lord) Lugard would define as a 'dual mandate' in his famous book of that name first published in 1922, was generally accepted as the theoretical justification for the European presence: social and economic development as much for the sake of the rest of the world as for Africa.\nIn contemporary imperialist ideology, therefore, the purpose of the European presence was defined in terms of a responsibility or trust. The British government's White Paper on Kenya issued in 1923, which established the principle of 'native paramountcy', included the statement that 'His Majesty's Government regard themselves as exercising a trust on behalf of the African populations ... the object of which may be defined plates I3.i(a)-(d) Colonial governors and administrators as the protection and advancement of the native races ...''

In Kenya, the Gikuyu accepted western innova› tions, modifying these to suit themselves while many of their neighbours tended to adopt the opposite stance.\nOne can, therefore, subscribe to the view that change as such was not new to colonial Africa and that there is no African society which was not affected to an appreciable extent by European contact or which simply withered before it. One must also concede that with colonial rule the ideology of change came to be consciously embraced by the rulers of Africa and their would-be friends. Even those colonial officials who were strongly committed to the policy and practice of indirect rule, with its emphasis on the preservation of traditional institutions and values, still recognized the need for change.

Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'.

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

Indeed, every colonial power in Black Africa depended on the chief, whether traditional or warrant in authority, as the basic element of the administrative structure. The French colonial administrator, Robert Delavignette, explained the nature of the system succinctly, and in a way applicable to more than the French West African situation, when he wrote: 'There is no colonization without native policy; no native policy without a territorial command; and no territorial command without native chiefs who serve as links between the colonial authority and the population.' 8 Although no observer or critic has doubted that chiefly activities were integral to the colonial system throughout the continent, there has been a considerable academic debate about the uses to which the various European powers put these chiefs.$^{9}$ The major question has centred on the difference between direct and indirect rule, between delegation of European authority to the African rulers and European mediation of traditional authority enjoyed by these rulers. While most scholarly interest has been directed to the distinction between the British and French modes of control in sub-Saharan Africa, where procedures, if not ultimate effects, were distinctive, the issue is perhaps best placed in historical perspective by a general review of continental policy, but with special attention still given to the activities of the British and French.\nThe most famous explanation of the importance of the 'native authority' to the colonial order was that of Lugard, who encased in theory the most discussed and imitated method of domination: indirect rule. As with so many administrators in the colonial realm, he made virtue of a widespread necessity, but few wrote so persuasively of that virtue.\nConfronted with the large territory of Northern Nigeria to administer after the transfer of the Royal Niger Company's authority to the state, and then faced with a shortage of men and funds, Lugard realized that any suggestion of direct control was out of the question. But such a conclusion was also supported by his belief, which had already been formed during his earlier service in Uganda, that the use of existing indigenous institutions was the best method of colonial administration. In his service as high commissioner for Northern Nigeria between 1900 and 1907, Lugard therefore developed his general practice and offered a detailed explanation of it in his many instructions to administrators, which were published as Political Memoranda.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.676, 'probability_score': 0.051}

In this attempt to integrate the emirs into the colonial system, Lugard wished to leave to them most of their old responsibilities, functions, and perquisites of office so that they would continue to appear in the eyes of the local populations as the legitimate rulers.\nIf, then, the essential of Lugard's rule was the use of existing authorities in existing capacities, something more was intended. Modifications along European lines were expected in matters such as justice and taxation. 11 'The great task of indirect rule,' wrote Lugard's biographer in an article defending his policy, 'is to hold the ring, to preserve a fair field within which Africans can strike their own balance between conservatism and adaptation.'$^{12}$ That task depended in large measure on the knowledge that European administrators had of local customs and institutions - and, of course, on the willingness of the native authorities to make such adjust› ments towards modernization within the context of their own institutions.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.651, 'probability_score': 0.049}

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation. Speaking of British policy in Africa, Lugard asserted that 'institutions and methods, in order to command success and promote the happiness and welfare of the people must be deep-rooted in their traditions and prejudices'.$^{5}$ Likewise the French Minister of Colonies, Georges LØyguŁs, had stated in 1906: 'The fundamental principle of our colonial policy must be scrupulous respect for the beliefs, habits and traditions of the conquered or protected peoples'. 6", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.656, 'probability_score': 0.05}

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all.

However, the colonial officials on the spot became, in effect, dictators instead of advisers to these traditional rulers and used them also to enforce some of the measures deemed obnoxious by their subjects such as forced labour, direct taxes and compulsory recruitment of men for the colonial armies. This manipulation of the institution of chieftaincy resulted in loss of prestige and respect of the traditional rulers in the eyes of their subjects. The colonial records, as recent research into rural politics in the inter-war years in Ghana has shown,$^{14}$ are full of revolts and rebellions by the young men against their chiefs and even their destoolment.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony.

Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas. In South Africa, Africans enjoyed no role whatsoever in the parliamentary procedures that were developed there. The Repre› sentation of Natives Act of 1936 effectively removed the Africans from the Cape Colony electoral rolls and limited their political status throughout the Union to the election of a limited number of whites who were to represent 'native interests'.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line.

The first was the new interest which the Duke of Brabant, crowned a constitutional king (Leopold I) of the Belgians in 1865, proclaimed in Africa. This was signified by the so-called Brussels Geographical Conference which he convened in 1876 and which resulted in the setting up of the African International Association and the employment of H. M. Stanley in 1879 to explore the Congos in the name of the Association. These moves culminated in the creation of the Congo Free State, whose recognition by all the great European nations Leopold managed to obtain before the Berlin West African conference had ended its deliberations. 35 The second significant series of events was the activities of Portugal from 1876 onwards. Piqued by the fact that it was invited to the Brussels conference only as an afterthought, Portugal sent out a flurry of expeditions which by 1880 had resulted in the annexation to the Portuguese crown of the practically independent estates of the Afro-Portuguese rulers in Mozambique.

The foremost exponents of this view, Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher, who stress the strategic importance of Africa to India for Britain, blame the partition of Africa on the impact of atavistic \'protonationalist\' movements in Africa which threatened the global strategic interests of European nations. These \'romantic, reactionary struggles\' gallant anachronisms in their view - compelled reluctant European states› men, hitherto content to exercise informal paramountcy and moral suasion in Africa, to partition and conquer the continent. Africa was occupied, therefore, not because of what it could offer materially to the Europeans for it was economically worthless - but because it was threatening European interests elsewhere. 18 One primary aim of the psychological theories as well as of their cousins, the diplomatic theories, has been to debunk the notion that the partition of Africa was motivated by economic impulses. But the prestige argument only appears unconvincing when its economic concomitant is eliminated or unduly played down. Hayes, for example, has documented in detail the tariff war which took place between the European nations during the crucial period of the partition. \'$^{9}$ He even concedes that, \'What actually started the economic push into the "Dark Continent" and the sun-baked islands of the Pacific was not so much an overproduction of factory goods in Europe as an under-supply of raw materials\';$^{20}$ and that therefore \'to prevent too much of the world from being ... monopolized by France, Germany, Italy, or any other protectionist power, Great Britain moved mightily to gather the lion\'s share into her own free-trade empire\'. In other words, neomercantilism, once established, had very important consequences for the emergence of imperial rivalries.$^{21}$ And yet, on the very next page, Hayes sets out to argue confidently, as we have seen, against the economic under› pinnings of the new imperialism. H. Brunschwig, too, while positing a non-economic interpretation of French imperialism was faced with the stark economic dimension of empire, and was thus compelled to assign it some role.

The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures.

These states were not essentially militaristic or expansionist. The campaigns they fought were either considered defensive, or essential for defining or delimiting the geographical boundaries of the state, or imperative for acquiring wealth in cattle. The founders of these states put much emphasis on strong defensible positions. Moshoeshoe built his capital on a flat-topped mountain (ghobosheane), Sobhuza located his capitals in inaccessible mountain areas, while Sebetwane chose the Kafue flood plain with its treacherous islands, a location that proved disastrous to unsuspecting enemies.\nThese defensive kingdoms did not maintain standing armies. Initiation age-mates functioned as military units in times of war. The kings inter› married extensively with their subjects to forge closer ties, especially with leading families, both in the core group and among the newly incorporated communities. Cattle were needed in order that they might be loaned out (the mafisa system) to favoured citizens or even whole chiefdoms. Consultation and local autonomy were much used to keep the disparate elements happy. These defensive states also attracted missionaries and strove hard to acquire guns and ammunition for defensive purposes. Even the conquest states ultimately admitted missionaries.\nAll these Mfecane states were founded on kinship as the basic social matrix on which the state was finally shaped. So was the institution of kingship. Both conquest and defensive states exploited the first-fruits ceremony as a ritual to stengthen the monarchy.

In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

The emergent labour force gradually became unionized in many colonies and added momentum to the expression of African nationalism through anti-colonial politics. As labour in the colonies exhibited all the malaise of a colonial situation, especially harsh exploitation based on racial discrimination and social injustice, labour relations automatically became political relations which were antagonistic as between the citizens of the colonizing country and the colonized Africans. The role of labour in the politics of African nationalism was to become very important from the Second World War onwards. 7\nThe role of the different official ideologies enunciated by the colonial powers was another determinant. As John Peel says 'An ideology, like the ideals of the great religions, is a factor shaping behaviour even when uncompletely realised ...' and 'Development does not occur apart from men's interpretation of their situation and ideas for their future.'$^{8}$ The differences in the orientation and style of African nationalists derived in part from the fact that the various groups had different ideologies to guide their expectations and by which to assess their achievements. Hence, among African nationalists under French control in Algeria and Senegal, where the possibility of ending colonialism through the policy of'assimila› tion' - by the attainment of French citizenship for individuals with full rights and responsibilities - had been demonstrated, the tendency was to continue to press for the extension, in scope and territorially, of the implementation of the policy. On the other hand, those in British territories, with the hope of eventual independence as separate sovereign countries, though as members of the British Commonwealth, were understandably more explicitly concerned during the period under consideration with reforms and participation which would prepare them ultimately for independence. The difference was not as to the objective of freedom, which they all wanted, but rather as to method.

The campaigns they fought were either considered defensive, or essential for defining or delimiting the geographical boundaries of the state, or imperative for acquiring wealth in cattle. The founders of these states put much emphasis on strong defensible positions. Moshoeshoe built his capital on a flat-topped mountain (ghobosheane), Sobhuza located his capitals in inaccessible mountain areas, while Sebetwane chose the Kafue flood plain with its treacherous islands, a location that proved disastrous to unsuspecting enemies.\nThese defensive kingdoms did not maintain standing armies.

The emergent labour force gradually became unionized in many colonies and added momentum to the expression of African nationalism through anti-colonial politics. As labour in the colonies exhibited all the malaise of a colonial situation, especially harsh exploitation based on racial discrimination and social injustice, labour relations automatically became political relations which were antagonistic as between the citizens of the colonizing country and the colonized Africans. The role of labour in the politics of African nationalism was to become very important from the Second World War onwards. 7\nThe role of the different official ideologies enunciated by the colonial powers was another determinant. As John Peel says 'An ideology, like the ideals of the great religions, is a factor shaping behaviour even when uncompletely realised ...' and 'Development does not occur apart from men's interpretation of their situation and ideas for their future.'$^{8}$ The differences in the orientation and style of African nationalists derived in part from the fact that the various groups had different ideologies to guide their expectations and by which to assess their achievements. Hence, among African nationalists under French control in Algeria and Senegal, where the possibility of ending colonialism through the policy of'assimila› tion' - by the attainment of French citizenship for individuals with full rights and responsibilities - had been demonstrated, the tendency was to continue to press for the extension, in scope and territorially, of the implementation of the policy. On the other hand, those in British territories, with the hope of eventual independence as separate sovereign countries, though as members of the British Commonwealth, were understandably more explicitly concerned during the period under consideration with reforms and participation which would prepare them ultimately for independence.

The campaigns they fought were either considered defensive, or essential for defining or delimiting the geographical boundaries of the state, or imperative for acquiring wealth in cattle. The founders of these states put much emphasis on strong defensible positions. Moshoeshoe built his capital on a flat-topped mountain (ghobosheane), Sobhuza located his capitals in inaccessible mountain areas, while Sebetwane chose the Kafue flood plain with its treacherous islands, a location that proved disastrous to unsuspecting enemies.\nThese defensive kingdoms did not maintain standing armies.

Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training.

Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

It attempted to recapture the Fante unity that had been destroyed by the decisive influences of the European presence. It foreshadowed the role that the educated elite would in future assume in the affairs of the Gold Coast: that of providing guidance for the non-literate traditional leaders of the peoples. It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns. After its defeat, anarchy took over in Kumasi and in the tributary countries to the north despite the policy of consolidation followed by Asantehene Kwaku Dwa III, called Prempeh (the Fat).

There is no doubt about the economic aspect of the Asante conquests in the south but it is clear that, in the early nineteenth century, the Asante were mainly interested in political domination over the other Akan peoples on whom they sought to impose their own central institutions. First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.603, 'probability_score': 0.049}

Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training.

These treaties took two forms - those between Africans and Europeans, and bilateral agreements between the Europeans themselves. The African-European treaties were basically of two kinds. Firstly, there were the slave trade and the commercial treaties; these had generated friction, which in turn led to European political interference in African affairs. Secondly, there were the political treaties by which African rulers either purportedly surrendered sovereignty in return for protection, or undertook not to enter into treaty obligations with other European nations.\nThese political treaties were in vogue during our period. They were made either by representatives of European governments or by those of private organizations who later transferred them to their respective govern› ments. If a metropolitan government accepted them, the territories in question were usually annexed or declared a protectorate; if, on the other hand, it suspected their authenticity, or if it felt constrained by the vicissi› tudes of Weltpolitik to exercise caution, these treaties were used for bargaining purposes during the bilateral European negotiations. Africans, on the other hand, entered into these arrangements for a variety of motives, but particularly because of the interests of their people. In some cases, they desired treaty relations with Europeans because they hoped that the prestige of such a relationship would endow them with certain political advantages in dealing with their neighbours. Sometimes a weak African state would desire a treaty with a European power in the hope of using it to renounce allegiance to another African state that claimed sovereignty over it. An African sovereign would also desire a treaty in the hope of using it to keep recalcitrant subject states in line. And sometimes a treaty with one European nation was seen by some African states as a means of preserving their independence which was being threatened by other European nations.$^{42}$ Whatever was the case, the African-European political treaties played an important role in the final partition of Africa.', 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.694, 'probability_score': 0.051}

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces.

This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate.

In a sense, the orientations of African leadership elites were shaped partly by the form of colonial administration. Where the administra› tions were regional in structure and/or policy, as in the French colonial federations, the African leaders tended to adopt a regional outlook. Hence, champions of African nationalism in the inter-war period (wanasiasa as they are known in Swahili) have been referred to as being primarily panAfricanists rather than nationalists in the European sense. The point was that nationalism was taking a reverse course to the expression of the same phenomenon in Europe. Contrary to what happened in Europe, the state was created before the cultural nations that would make it a meaningful political community were welded together. It is in this sense that one should take James Coleman's observation that: ... the drive behind African nationalism in many instances is not the consciousness of belonging to a distinct politico-cultural unit which is seeking to protect or assert itself, but rather it is the movement of racially-conscious modernists seeking to create new political and cultural nationalities out of the heterogenous people within the artificial boundaries imposed by the European master ... '\nWe must recognize that colonialism, as a system of relations, rests upon some kind of racialism, and that since development in a colonial situation is a product of interactions between the colonizer and the colonized, racial consciousness is basic to the growth of nationalism as a search for sovereignty and independence.\nThat African nationalists are regarded as 'modernists' is a reflection of the fact that they were operating within an externally defined setting which imposed alien systems of values, norms, and definitions of political and social developments to which they had to subscribe as a condition for success. That nationalism in Africa is a dynamic, ongoing phenomenon is clear from the extensive literature on themes like nation-building and irredentism.

That part of the nineteenth century which preceded the onset of European rule was the most liberal phase of Europe's relation› ship with Africa. Between the abolition of the slave trade and the imposition of colonial rule, Europe was by and large prepared to encourage the emergence of a group of Africans equipped to co-operate with her in the business of 'civilizing' the continent. This meant encouraging African initiative in education and commerce. As a result West Africa gained immensely through the application of this policy.\nBut with the imposition of colonial rule with its concomitant illiberal racial policies, all kinds of obstacles were placed in the way of free African participation in education and commerce. As a result those regions where the earlier liberal policies had not taken firm root before the dawn of alien rule, found themselves greatly handicapped. The colonial powers were by and large suspicious of the new African elites and sought to restrict their growth by slowing up the expansion of schools, while those who succeeded in graduating from the schools were frustrated through being denied fitting jobs in the colonial service. Also their scope for participation in the new commercial ventures was narrowed down to a minimum.\nEqually important in helping to explain the differential impact of these forces was the presence or absence of white settlers. There were very few European settlers in West Africa and this to some extent explains the relatively rapid progress of the West Africans in educational and economic matters. But settlers were present in force in Algeria, Kenya, the Rhodesias, South Africa and the Portuguese territories. In the Belgian Congo where there were fewer settlers, company rule was as illiberal and debilitating as settler influence.

Even when they emphasized 'native paramountcy', they did so with the thought that the welfare of the African populations could only be guaranteed and effectively structured socially and economically by them. Good government and independent government were, as Lord Cromer once remarked, opposing objectives in a colonial context. Thus the colonial system existed as an authoritarian one, and it was in no meaningful way calculated to confer political power upon the Africans it supposedly served. Its most common characteristic was paternalism, with shared responsibility at best only tolerated in areas of considerable white settlement. The history of the changing purposes and interpretation of 'native paramountcy' in Kenya is instructive in this matter. The White Paper of 1923 employed the concept as a device by which to stave off the demands of the Indian population for equitable representation in the affairs of the colony. Subsequent White Papers issued in 1927 and 1930 qualified the concept and contained concessions to the growing white residential population which was now allowed to join in the responsibilities of'trusteeship'. Native paramountcy therefore did not really imply dominance of African interests, but only respect for them.\nEven where parliamentary institutions were introduced to provide a degree of responsible colonial government, this arrangement was effected so that white preponderance was guaranteed. In Algeria, for instance, a twocollege electoral system, sanctioned by the Jonnart Law of 1919, provided proportionately lower Arab participation than European in the DØlØgations financiŁres, the incipient parliamentary body representing interest groups, not geographic areas.

However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training.

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all.

In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate.

This answer can be documented from the very words of the contemporary African leaders themselves. In 1891, when the British offered protection to Prempeh I of Asante in the Gold Coast, he replied: The suggestion that Asante in its present state should come and enjoy the protection of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress of India I may say is a matter of very serious consideration, and which I am happy to say we have arrived at this conclusion, that my kingdom of Asante will never commit itself to any such policy. Asante must remain as of old at the same time to remain friendly with all white men.

The ideologies of revolt were thought of as 'the magic of despair', bound to fail and incapable of pointing to the future. In such a view the resistances, however heroic, were tragic dead ends. 6\nOver the last decade or so historians of resistance have sought to combat this sort of interpretation. They have done this in two ways, by asserting strictly secular ideologies of revolt, and by 'disinfecting' religious ideologies.\nThe chief secular ideology which has been proposed is the concept of 'sovereignty'. Jacob Ajayi has written that 'the most fundamental aspect of the European impact was the loss of sovereignty .,. once a people lose their sovereignty, and they are exposed to another culture, they lose at least a little of their self-confidence and self-respect; they lose their right of self-steering, their freedom of choice as to what to change in their own culture or what to copy or reject from the other culture.' 7 A similar point is made with more emphasis by Walter Rodney: The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism ... springs mainly from the fact that Africa lost power ... During the centuries of precolonial trade some control over social, political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism ... The power to act independently is the guarantee to participate actively and consciously in history.

Meebelo has called 'a popular revulsion against the ruling class', and where the aristocracy of Barotseland feared a slave uprising if they attempted to oppose the extension of British influence. ' 8 A number of historians, indeed, have stressed the importance of dis› criminating between resistances which were motivated by the desire of a ruling group to retain its exploitative power, and resistances on a much wider scale, which were often directed as much against the authoritarianism of African rulers as against colonial oppression. Edward Steinhart urges that protest and resistance can be and are directed ... against domestic forms of oppression ... Protest must be viewed as something other than the expression of national aspirations ... by focusing on leader› ship we have accepted the interpretation of anti-colonialism as 'African nationalism', a movement to expel aliens and to restore 'national' independence. If instead we look within the protest movements ... we are apt to discover that the impulses which the leaders organize and interpret are profoundly anti-authoritarian and revolutionary rather than anti-foreign and 'nationalist'. 19 Even where a long-established polity enjoyed a leadership with recog› nized legitimacy and was able to mobilize the majority of its population into resistance, recent historians have been inclined to criticize 'the narrow sense of primordial loyalty' and the 'parochialism' which did no more than to focus on sovereignty as previously understood. Such historians have emphasized instead the significance of those resistances in which the idea of sovereignty was redefined. Thus Isaacman argues that the 1917 revolt in the Zambezi valley was unlike previous resistances there, 'which were designed to regain the independence of a historical polity or a group of related peoples'. The 1917 revolt 'sought to liberate all the peoples of the Zambezi from colonial oppression', appealing especially to the oppressed peasantry of whatever ethnicity.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante.

The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations.

First of all, the tribute extorted from the vanquished peoples gradually became a war tax (apealoo)}1 Then, the great Asante oath, the Ntam Kesie, deemed to be the supreme instrument of justice, was instituted among the other Akan peoples and their own local oaths were subordinated to it.18 At a later stage, the main Akan leaders in the surrounding areas were required to attend the annual ceremony of the Odwira, at which they had to pay homage to their suzerain, the Asantehene.19 Lastly, contingents from all the Akan states fought as Asante forces in Asante wars inside and outside the empire. The problem of sovereignty led to frequent clashes between the Asante and the other Akan, or the Europeans. The closing of the trade routes leading to Accra, decreed by the Akyem and the Akuapem was the cause of wars with the Asantehene since he considered it mainly as an act of rebellion and a rejection of the political domination of the Asante. Asante attacks on the Fante were inspired by this same desire for political hegemony.\nAs proof of sovereignty, the Asantehene referred to documents binding the signatories to pay rent for Cape Coast Castle and Fort Anomabo, which he said he had acquired during the conquest of Fante territory in 1807.20 After the defeat of Gyaman in 1818, the Asantehene declared that the people of Kommenda and Cape Coast should pay the aseda, a levy of gratitude, to express joy at the victory of their lord and master.21 In 1822, the Asantehene's commissioners went so far as to demand the trial and punishment of a police sergeant at Fort Anomabo because he did not react properly when an Asante tradesman uttered the Asantehene's oath before him. 22", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.665, 'probability_score': 0.051}

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country. Particular emphasis was placed on the promotion of education of both sexes and on industrial training.

The rulers of Madagascar tried to balance British Protestants and French Catholics, then rejected both and sought to ban their religious activities, and ended up getting the court and the bureaucratic elite to become Protestant while Catholicism made significant progress in some of the provinces. The rulers tried to use European ideas in diplomacy, judicial reforms, military reorganization and in establishing a constitutional monarchy.$^{13}$ Similarly, beleaguered as they were by aggressive white racialism, a number of the new states in Southern Africa such as Moshoeshoe's kingdom of the Basuto accepted missionaries as their advisers and external champions, protected them and even prom› ulgated laws to assist them in their work of conversion.$^{14}$ In the Fante states on the Gold Coast and at other important missionary centres, notably Abeokuta in south-western Yorubaland, a number of Western-educated African leaders used their literacy and European contacts to get reforms carried out in the traditional state structures. These included the creation of chancelleries to be managed by literate Africans to control diplomatic relations with Europeans and guide the external relations of the states; the reform of tax systems by the introduction of regulated taxes in place of tolls and tribute; and the improvement of the judicial system by the introduction of record-keeping and putting enacted laws into writing. 15", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.649, 'probability_score': 0.05}

The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

The grand lesson of the slave trade era long driven home in West and Central Africa, and being learnt in East Africa in the course of the nineteenth century, was that the way to survive and perhaps even profit from the slave trade was to strengthen the structures and military basis of state power.\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, as we have noted in most parts of Africa, 'the political and economic structures ... seemed to have a certain fragility about them. There appears to have been a perpetual ebb and flow in the frontiers of the state systems, and in the rise and fall of administrative centres.'$^{2}$ The state made minimum demands on people in the payment of homage, tribute and military service in return for protection. In most cases, the day-to-day life of the people largely revolved around a network of kinship, religious, judicial and economic institutions that often cut across state frontiers. Only in the Maghrib and Egypt had the operation of Islamic law over several centuries produced political structures with an appreciable level of durability. Elsewhere in Africa, tremendous effort had to be invested in the nineteenth century to evolve new and potentially more durable political structures. In the intense political rivalries that resulted, some of the effort was no doubt counterproductive and in some places the first visible result was disintegration of empires and decentralization, if not fragmentation, of authority.

Brutal massacres and secessionist move› ments were led by the very people who were supposed to represent authority...

In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

The reasons for general concurrence on this broad principle of rule are varied. First, the historical pattern of late nineteenth-century colonial acquisition was a formative factor, as size alone added a new dimension to the problem of colonial rule. Secondly the internal penetration of Africa rapidly outpaced the numbers of European personnel available to administer the newly possessed lands. Furthermore, since such penetration extended into many regions yet untouched by European cultural contact, direct rule of any kind would have been an entirely new experience and therefore immediately unworkable. Primarily as a result of these conditions, previously noted by several critics,$^{4}$ the direct rule characteristic of the smaller possessions on the coast gave way to the indirect rule of the larger possessions in the interior. Furthermore, at the turn of the century, the collapse of rule by chartered companies necessitated the establishment of national control over weakly held extensive territories. Yet this condition was in turn met (except in German East Africa) with a type of informal rule similar to the loose methods employed previously by the companies, as was most evident in Italian Somaliland.\nThere were also reasons which sprang from European cultural percep› tions and announced political intentions. Not only was there widespread acceptance of the principle of empire 'on the cheap', with little or no direct cost to the metropolitan state, but there was also general agreement that the least social dislocation would assure the most indigenous co-operation.

Even in the absence of a clear theory, however, a critical examination of colonial relations brings to light some fundamental assumptions which seem to have acted as guidelines for both the framers and implementers of colonial economic policies. First, the colonies were expected to provide raw materials (agricultural products and minerals) to feed the machines of the industrial imperial power. Second, the colonies had to import manufactured goods from the imperial power. These two assumptions divided the empire into two distinct economic camps - the colonies and the metropolis. Significantly there was very little reciprocity in the relationship. While in most cases the colonies had an obligation to export to Britain before they could consider any other buyer, even if such a buyer would pay higher prices, Britain had no obligation to import exclusively from any of her colonies. She operated through rational econo› mic choices and bought from whoever sold at low prices. The colonized people were also at a disadvantage in the import trade. In some cases they had to buy expensive British manufactures as the colonial state apparatus, under pressure from Britain, raised customs duties for non-British goods.

There is no doubt that in many states in Africa, partly as a result of the large increase in the number of the educated elite and the 'ulama$^{y}$, who naturally began to demand a say in the administration of their countries, a number of political and constitutional experiments were embarked upon. In fact, the Fulbe djiKàd of the first half of the nineteenth century could also be described as the militant political answer to this confrontation between the new educated elite of the 'ulama* and the traditional ruling elite, while the Joola rebellions of the second half of the nineteenth century could be regarded, as indeed Yves Person has shown, as a revolt of the educated mercantile class against the conservative ruling elite.$^{57}$ In other parts of Africa, especially on the west coast, this confrontation was not resolved in such a militant and violent way, but rather in more constitutional approaches. Indeed, during the period under review, the educated elite did not seek to replace the old aristocracy as the national leaders of the people as they were to do in the 1920s and 1930s but rather sought accommodation within the system and co-operation with them. In this connection, we have already referred to the constitutional experiments that followed the Yoruba migrations. However, nothing illustrates this trend better than the Constitution of the Fante Confederation of the Gold Coast, drawn up in 1874. Articles 4, 5 and 6 of that Constitution read: 58 The objects of the Fante Confederation as stated in this Constitution were no less interesting and significant. These were to promote friendly intercourse between and to unite all the kings and chiefs of Fante for offensive purposes against their common enemy; to make 'good and sub› stantial roads throughout all the interior districts included in the Con› federation' which were to be 'fifteen feet broad, with good gutters on either side'; and establish schools for the education of all children within the Confederation and 'to obtain the service of efficient school-masters'. Others were to promote agricultural and industrial pursuits and introduce 'such new plants as may hereafter become sources of profitable commerce to the country' and, finally, to develop and facilitate the working of the mineral and other resources of the country.

The representative assembly, for its part, made up of delegations of two members (a chief and a learned person) from each kingdom, was presided over by the vice-president, who also presided over the executive council. In 1872, however, this constitution was amended in order to make the legitimacy of the confederation subject to recognition by the British government, which was further required to provide half of the budget of the confederation and, failing that, to assume all its responsibilities by converting the Gold Coast into a colony. The con› federation had of course become operational in three years, raising an army of 15 000 men, setting up institutions and officials, including the supreme court, and levying a tax of which two-thirds went to the confederation and one-third to the member chieftaincies.\nTo the east, around Accra, it inspired a similar confederation, but a very timid one in the face of the power of the chiefs in that region. Moreover the autonomist movement in the west was already dying out by 1872, for in that year the Dutch finally sold their forts and left the Gold Coast, thus removing one reason for fear on the part of the confederated chiefs - whose army, incidentally, was not successful in forcing a decision against Fort Elmina, and whose financial resources remained inadequate.

It thus indicated the way in which the colonial situation, in providing education, was also providing the instrument of its own ultimate destruction. This was the basis of the antagonism that the colonial governments thereafter showed to the educated elite.\nIn 1872 the Asante sent an invasion force south to enforce what they regarded as their ancient right to Elmina and to revive their claims to Assin, Denkyira and Akyem. Having suppressed the Confederation and bought out the Dutch in 1872, the British decided to organize a response that would settle the Asante question once and for all. In 1874 they despatched a strong army under General Wolseley which captured and burnt Kumasi. In the same year, the Treaty of Fomena, under which Asante definitively renounced all its rights on the Gold Coast was imposed on the Asantehene, Kofi Karikari.\nAsante was further weakened in 1875 by its war with Dwaben, which was defeated, its inhabitants seeking refuge in the British protectorate. Now Dwaben was one of the most valiant and faithful central Asante towns.

The Swazi, the Gaza and the Ndebele are good examples of such polities. Many survivors of the wars either joined such leaders to increase the membership of the emerging political states or they were absorbed into already existing polities.

On the credit side, there was a remarkable spread of Islamic culture, accompanied by (as was rare in sub-Saharan Africa) frequent use of Fulfulde in written form. Though highly cultured, the aristocracy marked itself off by stockbreeding and warfare and also by certain forms of adventurous trade.

They did not obliterate all traces of former settlers, but where there had previously been a great variety of clan loyalties, the nineteenth century saw the gradual development of a sense of sharing the same civilization, language, and political organizations, usually in small chief› doms. A feeling of ethnic identity grew out of this shared historical experience, in which increases in population and agricultural productivity, and also encouragement of individual enterprise, played a key role. During the same period, in small high-density areas on the upper Tshikapa and the upper Kasai, there were many young Chokwe who were prepared to leave their villages and the burdensome power of the chiefs and take to the open forest, hunting elephants, setting up hives and collecting the honey and wax. Because of their skill with plants, particularly cassava, which can tolerate poor soils, the women who went with them were able to start growing crops: these women often came from small Lunda settlements along the tributaries of the Luembe, the Tshikapa, etc.\nThe assimilation of Lunda women into Chokwe society illustrates a phenomenon that was widespread throughout the 'matrilineal belt': descendants of female captives were members not of their mother's clan (this was the privilege of the free-born), but of their father's. There were many of these descendants of slaves everywhere: among the Kongo they were the baæa ba tizo (children of the house), among the Chokwe the ana a tshihunda (children of the village), and among the Pende of Kwilu they even make up the majority of members of rich and powerful clans. 11 Genealogical trees show that the practice of assimilating captives was very common in the nineteenth century. ii. The assimilation of dependents is studied by L. de Sousberghe, 1961.", 'last_edit_date': None, 'url': None, 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.592, 'probability_score': 0.049}
