HH: The Fanti Confederation's recognition by British authorities indicates a shift in colonial policy towards accommodating indigenous political structures.

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides details that both support and refute the claim regarding the Fante Confederation's recognition by British authorities as a shift in colonial policy towards accommodating indigenous political structures. On one hand, the textbook describes the Fante Confederation as a significant constitutional experiment that aimed to unite local chiefs and promote socio-economic development, indicating a progressive approach to indigenous governance. However, it also notes that the British ultimately suppressed the Confederation by 1873, suggesting a reluctance to fully accommodate such indigenous political structures.

This indicates that while there may have been some initial openness to indigenous political structures, the overall colonial policy did not significantly shift towards accommodating them, as evidenced by the eventual suppression of the Confederation. Thus, the textbook presents a nuanced view that highlights both the potential for accommodation and the ultimate resistance to it by colonial authorities.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide details that support the claim that the Fanti Confederation's recognition by British authorities indicates a shift in colonial policy towards accommodating indigenous political structures. Initially, the British, under Mr. Ussher, distanced themselves from the Fantis, refusing to have any relations with them and warning them of the consequences of provoking a war with Ashanti. However, this stance changed when Mr. Simpson took over as the chief of the Executive. He recognized the Fanti Confederation, giving it the style and designation of the "Fanti Confederacy," and acknowledged its authority over the interior districts of the protectorate. This recognition and the subsequent cooperation, such as involving the Confederation in the ransom negotiations for captured Dutch officers, suggest a shift towards accommodating and working with indigenous political structures. The assignment of Gothic House as a temporary residence for the Confederation's officers further indicates a level of official recognition and support from the British authorities.

This suggests that the Confederation had ambitions to exert influence over its territories, aligning with the claim. However, the Confederation's authority was short-lived and ultimately undermined by external forces, such as the British colonial administration, which repressed intellectuals and divided the chiefs, leading to its collapse. This indicates that while indigenous political entities like the Fante Confederation had the potential to exert influence, their authority was limited and often curtailed by colonial powers. Therefore, the textbook provides a nuanced view that both supports and challenges the claim, highlighting the complexities of indigenous political influence during the colonial period.
