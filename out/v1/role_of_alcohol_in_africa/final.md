The introduction of alcohol by European traders had a significant impact on African societies, as observed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, though they offer differing emphases on its effects. The General History of Africa acknowledges the negative health impacts of alcohol, noting that the widespread distribution of strong spirits, often used as wages, had deleterious effects on health and was a significant trade item. However, it does not explicitly link alcohol to the decline of coastal tribes, instead presenting it as one of several factors, alongside commerce, the slave trade, and colonialism, affecting African societies. Alcohol was also integrated into economic systems as a medium of exchange in economies lacking widely accepted currencies, suggesting a complex role beyond mere destruction. In contrast, The African Times strongly supports the claim that alcohol had a devastating impact, particularly on coastal tribes. The Rev. Mr. Walker, an American missionary, describes alcohol as a "burning curse" and criticizes traders for prioritizing profit over community well-being, attributing a significant portion of local population decline to alcohol's destructive influence. The articles emphasize the widespread detrimental effects, likening them to horrors greater than the middle passage, and highlight European involvement, noting that much of the liquor exported from Liverpool was destined for the African coast. Together, these sources illustrate the multifaceted impact of alcohol on African societies, with The African Times providing a more direct link to the decline of coastal tribes.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles collectively support the claim that the alcohol trade in Africa was driven by European and American traders who prioritized profit over the well-being of African communities, leading to widespread social and health issues. The General History of Africa textbook details how European traders produced alcohol cheaply and sold it for immense profits in Africa, emphasizing their economic motivations. It highlights the negative health impacts, with spirits often distributed as wages and contributing significantly to government revenue, as seen in the Niger Coast Protectorate. However, the textbook does not explicitly mention American traders or provide detailed accounts of specific social issues caused by the alcohol trade, focusing more on economic and health implications. In contrast, The African Times articles strongly emphasize both European and American involvement, with traders described as remorselessly prioritizing profit, even at the cost of African lives. The articles note that nine-tenths of the liquor exported from Liverpool was destined for Africa, implicating European traders, while American traders behaved similarly. They also detail the devastating social impact, including tribal degradation, wages paid in spirits, and labor unavailability due to drunkenness. Citing figures like Mr. Jas. Irvine and Mr. Joseph Thomson, the articles compare the liquor trade's impact to slavery and criticize the hypocrisy of promoting European trade as a civilizing force while exacerbating social issues. Together, these sources underscore the prioritization of profit by European and American traders at the expense of African well-being, with The African Times providing a more comprehensive account of the social consequences.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary perspectives on the claim that alcohol consumption in Africa, exacerbated by foreign traders, was destructive to both the local population and the traders themselves, with high mortality rates on both sides. The textbook highlights the influx of strong European alcoholic drinks into Africa, driven by their profitability and the lack of widely accepted mediums of exchange in African economies. It notes that spirits were often distributed as wages and significantly contributed to government revenue, such as in the Niger Coast Protectorate. While the textbook underscores the economic and social impacts of the alcohol trade, including its role in the colonial economy and its contribution to health issues, it does not explicitly discuss high mortality rates associated with alcohol consumption for either the local population or the traders. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim, with accounts like that of Rev. Mr. Walker describing alcohol as a "burning curse" that has killed a significant portion of both Africans and traders. The articles highlight the traders' recklessness, driven by profit, and compare regions like Senegambia and Sierra Leone to illustrate the detrimental effects of alcohol where it is prevalent. This comparison underscores the destructive nature of alcohol consumption in unregulated regions. Together, these sources offer a nuanced view, with the textbook focusing on economic and social impacts, while the news articles emphasize the widespread harm and high mortality rates associated with alcohol consumption.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles offer differing perspectives on the impact of alcohol in Africa compared to the transatlantic slave trade. The textbook acknowledges the negative effects of alcohol on African societies, noting its detrimental impact on health and its role as a significant source of government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate. However, it does not equate the spread of alcohol with the catastrophic effects of the transatlantic slave trade, which is depicted as causing profound social and political upheaval, economic dependency, and significant population loss. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that the spread of alcohol was a form of cultural and social destruction akin to the horrors of the slave trade. Rev. Mr. Walker describes alcohol as "the burning curse of this country," comparing its impact to the middle passage by stating that the "fiery stream of alcohol rolls and burns, causing waste and anguish and horrors greater than the middle passage ever witnessed." The articles highlight the payment of wages in spirits, leading to widespread drunkenness and degradation of West African tribes, and emphasize the complicity of European traders in perpetuating this destruction, similar to their role in the slave trade. While the articles suggest a comparable level of destruction, they do not provide a detailed comparison of the scale or specific mechanisms between the alcohol trade and the transatlantic slave trade, leaving room for further historical analysis.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide differing perspectives on the claim that alcohol consumption was seen as a greater obstacle to progress and development in Africa than traditional religious practices. The General History of Africa highlights the economic significance of the alcohol trade, such as in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits contributed substantially to government revenue. However, it does not explicitly compare alcohol consumption to traditional religious practices as obstacles to progress. Instead, it discusses the disintegrating effect of Christianity on African culture, as missionaries condemned traditional practices, leading to a loss of African identity and cultural cohesion. This suggests that traditional religious practices were undermined by external influences rather than being inherent obstacles. In contrast, The African Times articles provide substantial support for the claim, with Rev. Mr. Walker describing alcohol as a "burning curse" responsible for significant social and demographic decline, equating its impact to the horrors of the middle passage. He argues that while heathenism is problematic, it is not as insurmountable as the challenges posed by alcohol. The articles also detail governmental and organizational efforts to curb the alcohol trade, such as the Royal Niger Company's actions to restrict alcohol importation, indicating a recognition of its detrimental effects. These accounts collectively suggest that alcohol consumption was perceived as a more significant barrier to progress than traditional religious practices, contrasting with the absence of direct comparison in the textbook.

The observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles converge on the claim that the introduction of European trade, including the liquor trade, has not necessarily led to the civilization or improvement of African societies but has instead exacerbated existing social issues. The General History of Africa highlights the negative impact of the liquor trade, noting that strong alcoholic drinks were distributed on a large scale, often as wages, contributing significantly to government revenue and adversely affecting health. It also points out the unequal value of commodities exchanged, such as ivory and captives, which distorted the economy and led to ecological destruction. The introduction of European trade intensified class antagonisms and social inequalities, disrupted internal political balances, and left indigenous trading communities vulnerable due to dependence on European arms and intermediaries. Although some positive developments, like the rise of rural capitalism and integration into the capitalist world-economy, are noted, these improvements are limited and uneven. Similarly, The African Times articles emphasize the detrimental impact of the liquor trade, with wages of native laborers, including children, sometimes paid in spirits, leading to widespread drunkenness and unproductivity. The scale of the liquor trade is described as enormous, with 60,000 hogsheads of spirits consumed annually in the Niger delta alone, and is considered a greater evil than slavery. Efforts by the Royal Niger Company to prohibit spirituous liquors in certain regions indicate recognition of these negative effects. The articles also suggest that European trade exacerbated pre-existing knowledge of intoxicants rather than introducing these issues. Together, these sources illustrate how European trade, particularly in liquor, has worsened social problems in Africa rather than contributing to its civilization or improvement.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide contrasting perspectives on the claim that the demand for spirits in Africa has grown disproportionately compared to other goods, indicating a deepening dependency on alcohol. The General History of Africa highlights the significant role of the trade in spirits in the economic landscape, particularly in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits contributed substantially to customs duties and government revenue by 1894. However, it does not provide evidence of a growing demand for spirits over other goods or a deepening dependency on alcohol, instead emphasizing the economic motivations behind the trade, such as the profitability of selling cheap European-produced alcohol and the challenges of barter economies. The text also discusses other economic activities, such as cash crops and minerals, suggesting a diverse economic landscape. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing extensive liquor trafficking, particularly on the West Coast, where the consumption of spirits is described as "prodigious" and "enormous." The articles cite Mr. Joseph Thomson, an African traveler, who notes that the appetite for spirits increases disproportionately compared to the desire for better things, indicating a deepening dependency. They also report the importation of over five million gallons of rum and gin into British West Africa in 1893, with an increasing supply rate, and discuss the negative impact on the native population, including tribal degradation and labor hindrance due to drunkenness. These observations from The African Times suggest a significant and growing demand for spirits, overshadowing other goods and contributing to a dependency on alcohol, contrasting with the more economically diverse portrayal in the General History of Africa.

The claim that the Royal Niger Company took a proactive stance against the liquor trade by prohibiting the import of spirits into most of its territories is supported by observations from The African Times but not directly addressed in the General History of Africa textbook. The African Times articles detail that the Royal Niger Company prohibited the importation of spirituous liquors into regions north of the seventh parallel of latitude, covering about nineteen-twentieths of their jurisdiction, and aimed to extend this policy further once its military force was strengthened. The articles highlight the effectiveness of this policy, noting a 75 percent reduction in spirit importation over four years, despite some smuggling. In contrast, the General History of Africa textbook emphasizes the significant role of the liquor trade in the region, noting that spirits were widely distributed, often as wages, and contributed substantially to government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate. The textbook also mentions the Brussels Act of 1892's unsuccessful attempts to regulate the trade in tropical Africa until the eve of the First World War, suggesting a prevalent and poorly controlled liquor trade during the period. The absence of specific mention of the Royal Niger Company's actions in the textbook contrasts with the detailed account in The African Times, highlighting a notable difference in perspectives on the effectiveness and implementation of liquor trade regulations.

The introduction and spread of alcohol in Africa during the colonial period is a complex issue with varying perspectives highlighted in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa textbook emphasizes the economic motivations behind the alcohol trade, noting its deleterious effects on health and its role in generating significant government revenue, such as in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where spirits accounted for half of the total government revenue and 95% of customs duties in 1894. The textbook also discusses the challenges in regulating the trade, as seen in the unsuccessful attempt to limit it through the Brussels Act of 1892. However, it does not explicitly state that colonial powers viewed alcohol as a threat to the social and moral fabric of African communities, focusing instead on economic aspects. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim that colonial powers perceived alcohol as a threat to the social and moral fabric of African communities. They highlight efforts by the British Government and the Royal Niger Company to curb the drink traffic among "half-civilized or savage races," reflecting a concern for the potential ruin and demoralization of native populations. Actions such as assisting chiefs in preventing the introduction of drink and prohibiting spirituous liquors in certain regions, along with a 75 percent reduction in spirit importation over four years, underscore the seriousness with which these colonial entities approached the issue. However, the articles do not delve into the broader social and moral implications for African communities, focusing instead on the policies and actions of colonial powers. Together, these sources provide a nuanced view of the alcohol trade in Africa, highlighting both economic motivations and colonial concerns about its social impact.

The narrative of alcohol as a destructive force in Africa, as explored in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles, reveals a complex interplay of economic, moral, and strategic motivations behind European and missionary interventions in African societies. The General History of Africa highlights the economic significance of the alcohol trade, noting the immense profits made by Europeans and its role in local economies, such as being used as wages and contributing to government revenue. However, it does not explicitly link the narrative of alcohol's destructiveness to justifications for intervention, instead focusing on other rationales like humanitarian and philanthropic zeal. In contrast, The African Times articles align more closely with the claim, detailing efforts by entities like the Royal Niger Company and the Anti-Slavery Conference at Brussels to prohibit liquor traffic as part of a moral and civilizing mission. Figures such as Rev. J. Grant Mills and Sir G. Taubman-Goldie emphasize the detrimental impact of European spirits, framing them as a destructive influence introduced by Europeans. The Company's actions, including imposing heavy duties and prohibiting alcohol importation, are presented as part of a civilizing effort, suggesting that controlling alcohol was intertwined with broader colonial objectives. This duality in the narrative reflects both a moral stance and a strategic approach to maintain influence and control, indicating that the narrative of alcohol's destructiveness served multiple purposes in the context of European intervention in Africa.

The General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide complementary insights into the role of alcohol consumption in the social and economic disparities observed in different parts of Africa during the colonial period. The General History of Africa highlights the significant role of alcohol in the colonial economy, noting its deleterious health effects and its contribution to government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate. It mentions the large-scale distribution of alcohol, often as wages, and the largely unsuccessful attempts to regulate the trade until the eve of the First World War. However, the textbook does not explicitly compare regions with different alcohol policies or directly link alcohol consumption to regional disparities, indicating a gap in its analysis. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more direct comparison, highlighting the impact of alcohol policies on regional disparities. They describe how the French-imposed high licenses on alcoholic drinks in Senegambia limited consumption to light French wines, resulting in a population that was cleaner, tidier, and superior physically, morally, and intellectually compared to Sierra Leone, where the prevalent trade in rum and gin led to dreadful conditions. The articles further emphasize the detrimental effects of the rum and gin trade, likening its harm to that of the slave trade, thus supporting the claim that alcohol consumption was a significant factor in the observed disparities. Together, these sources suggest that while the textbook provides a broad overview of alcohol's economic role, the news articles offer specific historical context that underscores the impact of alcohol policies on social and economic conditions in colonial Africa.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present differing perspectives on the involvement of organizations like the Y.M.C.A. in addressing the alcohol trade in African societies. The General History of Africa does not mention the Y.M.C.A. or any specific organizations focusing on the alcohol trade, instead highlighting various African clubs, associations, and movements that emerged in response to colonial rule, addressing issues such as land rights, racial discrimination, and political representation. While social reform and advocacy are discussed, they are not directly linked to alcohol-related concerns, indicating a gap in the textbook's coverage of this specific aspect of social reform during the colonial period. In contrast, The African Times articles support the claim by detailing the involvement of organizations like the Y.M.C.A. in advocating against the negative impacts of alcohol. A document from the Y.M.C.A. of Abeokuta is highlighted, which compares the harm of the rum and gin trade to that of the slave trade, demonstrating a recognized need for social reform. Additionally, the articles mention the Aborigines Protection Society's efforts to appeal to the British government for liquor traffic regulation reform in Africa. While the articles do not elaborate on the Y.M.C.A.'s broader involvement, they corroborate the claim by illustrating active organizational advocacy for social reform concerning the alcohol trade in Africa.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles present a nuanced view of the British government's and colonial authorities' stance on the impact of alcohol on African societies. The General History of Africa suggests that while certain African leaders, such as Kgama and Lewanika, imposed stringent liquor laws due to their personal convictions and Christian values, these actions were not directly driven by British intervention. The textbook also highlights the economic significance of alcohol in colonial economies, particularly in the Niger Coast Protectorate, where government revenue heavily relied on the trade of spirits, indicating that economic interests often overshadowed social concerns. Furthermore, the Brussels Act of 1892, which aimed to limit alcohol trade in the Congo, was largely ineffective, with meaningful regulation not occurring until the eve of World War I. In contrast, The African Times articles provide evidence of a proactive stance by the British government and colonial authorities, as exemplified by Baron H. De Worms' emphasis on preventing alcohol spread among "half-civilized or savage races" and the Royal Niger Company's prohibition of spirit imports, which led to a significant reduction in spirit imports. Additionally, advocacy by figures like Mr. H. R. Fox Bourne for increased duties on imported spirits and international cooperation underscores the concern and proposed measures. However, both sources acknowledge that despite these efforts, the importation of alcohol remained substantial, highlighting the complexity and challenges in effectively addressing the issue. Together, these observations suggest that while there were efforts to control alcohol distribution, they were often inconsistent and influenced by competing economic and social priorities.

The observations from the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the impact of regulatory measures on alcohol availability and consumption in colonial territories. The General History of Africa highlights the significant influx of strong alcoholic drinks into Africa, driven by the profitability of cheap European alcohol and the absence of widely accepted mediums of exchange in African economies. Spirits were often distributed as wages, and a substantial portion of government revenue in the Niger Coast Protectorate was derived from them. Although the Brussels Act of 1892 attempted to limit alcohol trade in the Congo, effective regulation in tropical Africa was not achieved until just before World War I, suggesting that while regulatory measures could impact alcohol availability and consumption, they were initially ineffective. The text does not specifically mention the Royal Niger Company, which is a notable omission. In contrast, The African Times articles provide specific details about the Royal Niger Company's efforts, noting a 75% reduction in alcohol importation over four years due to their policies. These included prohibiting spirituous liquors in certain regions, imposing penalties on wages paid in spirits, and implementing heavy duties on imported spirits. The articles also mention the complete prohibition of alcohol importation in the Benue districts and the challenges posed by low duties in neighboring regions like Lagos. These actions illustrate the effectiveness of regulatory measures, while also acknowledging the complexities of implementation due to European traders' influence and local liquor production. Together, these sources suggest that regulatory measures could significantly impact alcohol availability and consumption, though their success varied depending on the context and enforcement.

The General History of Africa textbook provides a broad context on the trade of alcoholic beverages in Africa during the colonial period, noting the widespread distribution of strong alcoholic drinks, which were produced cheaply in Europe and sold for immense profits in Africa. It highlights that alcohol was often used as wages and contributed significantly to government revenue in regions like the Niger Coast Protectorate. However, it does not specifically address the economic value of imported alcoholic beverages in the Gold Coast or its integration into colonial trade systems. In contrast, The African Times news articles offer detailed support for the claim regarding the economic value of imported alcoholic beverages in the Gold Coast, reflecting colonial trade systems and demand within African markets. The articles provide specific figures for the importation of various alcoholic beverages in 1892, such as rum, gin, whiskey, brandy, wines, ale, and porter, with their respective values in pounds sterling, indicating a structured trade system and significant imports. The involvement of the Colonial Secretary, Mr. F. M. Hodson, and his analysis of consumption patterns further underscores the colonial administrative interest in these imports. Additionally, the comparison of consumption levels between the Gold Coast and the United Kingdom highlights the demand and consumption patterns within the African market, suggesting integration into colonial economic practices. However, the articles do not delve into the broader economic implications or the impact on local economies, which would be crucial for historians examining the full extent of colonial trade integration. This absence of broader economic context is a notable difference from the claim.
