The Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes and its impact on regional trade is well-documented in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook highlights the Ashanti Kingdom's significant economic and political power under leaders like Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu, emphasizing their intermediary position between the Niger Bend and the Gulf of Guinea coast, which facilitated their dominance in trade. The Ashanti's structural reforms and military campaigns enabled them to exert influence over coastal trading posts, crucial for economic survival, especially after the abolition of the slave trade. Their adaptability in shifting to palm oil and rubber exports and the imposition of political institutions and tribute systems on conquered territories further underscore their control over regional trade dynamics. However, the textbook focuses more on their broader political and economic influence rather than specific trade routes. In contrast, The African Times articles provide a more detailed account of the Ashanti's direct control over trade routes, describing how they historically monopolized trade under leaders like Calcalli by acting as a barrier for northern tribes rich in gold and cotton seeking access to the sea. Kumasi, the Ashanti capital, was a central hub for traders from both the north and south, illustrating its pivotal role in controlling trade routes. The Ashanti's policy of checking the enterprising spirit of neighboring tribes maintained their trade monopoly, contributing to the fear and subjugation of these tribes. The potential dissolution of the Ashanti Kingdom is suggested to benefit trade by breaking this monopoly, allowing other tribes and Europeans to access the coast. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the Ashanti Kingdom's profound impact on regional trade through both broad economic influence and specific control over trade routes.

The British military intervention had profound and lasting effects on the Ashanti Kingdom, as detailed in both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook outlines a long history of confrontation between the British and the Ashanti, beginning in the 1760s and culminating in significant military engagements, such as the Ashanti's defeat of the British in 1824 and the British victory at Dodowa in 1826. The decisive British campaign led by General Garnet Wolseley in 1874 resulted in the sacking of Kumasi and the disintegration of the Ashanti Empire, as formalized in the Treaty of Fomena. This treaty recognized the independence of vassal states and weakened Ashanti's military power. The British further consolidated their control by deposing the Asantehene and instigating internal conflicts within the Ashanti Union, culminating in the annexation of Ashanti in 1901 following the Kumasi expedition of 1900. The African Times articles corroborate these events, emphasizing the destruction of Kumasi as a pivotal moment and highlighting battles at Essamacow, Effootoo, and Doodowah, which resulted in Ashanti losses. The articles also discuss the political fragmentation within the Ashanti Kingdom, with states like Adansi, Becqua, and Juabin seeking to secede and align with the British Protectorate, illustrating the weakening of Ashanti's centralized power. Additionally, the Ashanti King's appeal for British assistance and the aspiration for a unified Gold Coast under British rule underscore the transformative impact of British intervention on the Ashanti Kingdom. Together, these sources illustrate the military and political consequences of British actions, leading to the Ashanti Kingdom's political and territorial fragmentation.

The portrayal of Kumasi and its decline is vividly captured through observations from both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa highlights the significant military defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874, which led to the disintegration of the Asante empire and the weakening of Kumasi's political power. The Treaty of Fomena further contributed to this decline by forcing Asante to recognize the independence of its vassal states. Internal conflicts, such as the civil war between Kumasi and Dwaben, exacerbated the situation, leading to further fragmentation and the eventual deposition of the Asantehene. The text underscores the influence of European colonial interests and British strategic maneuvers to prevent the revival of the Asante empire, focusing primarily on political and military events. In contrast, The African Times provides a detailed portrayal of Kumasi's physical and social decline. The articles describe Kumasi as a small town with a population significantly affected by war, historically never exceeding 15,000 residents but swelling to 80,000 during grand occasions. Since the 1874 expedition, the population has diminished, possibly to as low as 5,000, with an additional 10,000 from surrounding villages. The town's lack of defensive walls, reliance on natural barriers, and the desolate state of its infrastructure, with overgrown roads and ruined houses, are highlighted. The deterioration of the palace and neglected streets, along with the presence of scavenging birds, suggest a continued association with past violence. Together, these sources support the claim of Kumasi's decline, illustrating both external pressures from European powers and internal strife, while also providing a vivid depiction of its past glory and current state of neglect.

The influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society is profoundly evident, as highlighted by both the General History of Africa textbook and The African Times news articles. The General History of Africa emphasizes the central role of the Golden Stool, a mystical symbol of unity and authority, deeply intertwined with the Asante's political and social structure, illustrating the integration of traditional beliefs into governance and identity. It also notes the reliance on traditional religious practices, such as oath-swearing and ceremonies, fundamental to the state's machinery and justice system, and highlights the use of religious beliefs as resistance against colonial rule. Despite the introduction of external religions like Islam and Christianity, traditional beliefs remained resilient. Complementing this, The African Times articles underscore the importance of traditional leadership structures, as seen in the Quocofocoos' refusal to serve under Koffee Carry Carry, who violated customary norms. The articles also highlight the role of traditional spiritual practices in governance and conflict resolution, such as a chief taking a "fetish" to maintain peace, and the influence of spiritual figures in personal and legal matters, exemplified by an Ashantee man seeking protection from execution. Additionally, the chief at Bogyawai's fear of the King's retribution for converting to Christianity further illustrates the powerful hold of traditional beliefs. Together, these observations from both sources demonstrate the pervasive influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society, shaping its political, social, and religious dynamics.

The challenges of travel and communication in the region are well-documented in both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles, each providing complementary insights. The textbook highlights the colonial-era construction of infrastructure such as railways, roads, telegraph lines, and harbors, primarily aimed at facilitating the export of goods rather than improving general welfare. Despite these developments, the infrastructure's role in 'opening up' the continent is considered exaggerated, as it served limited areas and established few inter-colonial links. Before colonial intervention, human porterage was the primary means of land transport, underscoring significant historical challenges. The integration of the eastern African hinterland with the coast involved transforming pre-existing regional trading networks, indicating complex and evolving travel and communication processes. The African Times articles further illustrate these challenges by describing the impact of the rainy season, which rendered rivers impassable and roads muddy, severely hindering travel. Communication was slow and unreliable, often delayed by the need to wait for the King's messengers. Travelers navigated narrow, newly cut paths, reflecting the lack of established infrastructure, while cultural protocols, such as the presence of a guide with a peacock's tail and ceremonial interactions with the King, added layers of complexity. Together, these sources paint a comprehensive picture of the logistical, historical, and cultural challenges that characterized travel and communication in the region.

The observations from both the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles provide a comprehensive view of the significant role that outsiders, particularly Europeans, played in influencing local customs and politics in Africa. The textbook highlights the profound impact of European colonial rule, which led to the loss of sovereignty for African states, the imposition of fixed colonial boundaries, and the transformation of political maps, disrupting traditional political and economic interactions. European colonial administrators established authoritarian systems that did not confer political power to Africans, as seen in Algeria and South Africa, and introduced new social and political structures, such as the tax system and indirect rule, altering traditional African institutions and governance. The cultural imposition of colonialism, including the spread of Christianity and Western education, further changed local customs and social structures. Meanwhile, The African Times articles provide specific examples of European intervention in local customs and politics, such as a European preventing a human sacrifice by appealing to a King, and Captain Lees' involvement in mediating political matters between local communities and the King. These interactions reflect a European presence in political negotiations and conflict resolution, although the articles also highlight the limitations of this influence, as seen in Captain Lees' inability to enforce the King's decrees and the refusal of local chiefs to submit to the King's demands. Together, these sources illustrate both the active involvement of Europeans in local affairs and the constraints they faced in altering entrenched customs and political dynamics, underscoring the complex and varied impact of European colonialism on African societies.

The depiction of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence is addressed differently in the "General History of Africa" textbook and The African Times news articles. The textbook does not directly address or depict Kumasi in this manner; instead, it focuses on various aspects of African history, such as political domination, resistance movements, cultural resilience, and the impact of colonialism. Kumasi is mentioned in the context of the Asante empire, particularly regarding political sovereignty and the influence of Islam, but there is no mention of human sacrifice or violence specific to Kumasi. This absence of information suggests that the textbook neither supports nor refutes the portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence, which an expert historian might find significant. In contrast, The African Times news articles strongly support the claim, describing Kumasi as a place where the "fiat of death" was a daily occurrence and the palace as the "head-quarters of human sacrifice." The articles emphasize the "natural ferocity or superstitious dread" of the chief occupant and mention the "perpetual smell of human blood and putrifying human flesh," reinforcing the image of Kumasi as a site of gruesome practices. The destruction of Kumasi is portrayed as retribution and purification, indicating a moral judgment against the city's violent history. These details align closely with the claim, as the articles do not provide any counter-narratives or mitigating factors regarding Kumasi's reputation.
