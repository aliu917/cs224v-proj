HH: The Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes and its impact on regional trade:

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes and its impact on regional trade. The Ashanti Kingdom, under leaders like Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu, wielded significant economic and political power over the coastal and northern kingdoms, which were crucial for controlling trade routes. The Ashanti's intermediary position between the Niger Bend and the Gulf of Guinea coast facilitated their dominance in trade. The kingdom's structural reforms and military campaigns allowed it to exert influence over the coastal trading posts, which were vital for its economic survival, especially after the abolition of the slave trade. The shift to palm oil and rubber as leading export products indicates the Ashanti's adaptability in maintaining trade control. Additionally, the Ashanti's imposition of political institutions and tribute systems on conquered territories further underscores their control over regional trade dynamics. However, the textbook does not explicitly detail the Ashanti's control over specific trade routes, focusing more on their political and economic influence over regions and the integration of various states into their empire. This suggests a broader impact on regional trade rather than direct control over specific trade routes.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes and its impact on regional trade. The articles describe how the Ashanti Kingdom, under the leadership of Calcalli, historically monopolized trade by acting as a barrier for tribes from the north rich in gold and cotton who desired to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. Kumasi, the capital of Ashanti, was described as the *ne plus ultra* for traders coming from both the north and the south, indicating its central role in controlling trade routes. The articles also mention that the Ashanti's policy was to check the enterprising spirit of neighboring tribes to maintain their trade monopoly. This control over trade routes contributed to the fear and subjugation of neighboring tribes, as evidenced by the historical difficulty of passing into the interior without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. The dissolution of the Ashanti Kingdom is suggested to potentially benefit trade in the long run, as it would break the Ashanti's trade monopoly and allow other tribes, including Germans and tribes at the back of Ashanti, to access the coast. These details align with the claim that the Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes significantly impacted regional trade dynamics.


HH: The British military intervention and its effects on the Ashanti Kingdom:

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding British military intervention and its effects on the Ashanti Kingdom. The text describes a long history of confrontation between the British and the Ashanti, beginning in the 1760s and culminating in significant military engagements, such as the defeat of the British by the Ashanti in 1824 and the subsequent British victory at Dodowa in 1826. The decisive British campaign led by General Garnet Wolseley in 1874 resulted in the sacking of Kumasi and the disintegration of the Ashanti Empire, as outlined in the Treaty of Fomena. This treaty recognized the independence of vassal states and led to the weakening of Ashanti's military power. The British further consolidated their control by deposing the Asantehene and instigating internal conflicts within the Ashanti Union. The text also highlights the British annexation of Ashanti in 1901 following the Kumasi expedition of 1900, which was part of a broader pattern of British military imperialism in West Africa. These details align with the claim that British military intervention had profound and lasting effects on the Ashanti Kingdom, leading to its political and territorial fragmentation.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding British military intervention and its effects on the Ashanti Kingdom. The articles describe the British destruction of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom, as a significant event, indicating the impact of British military actions. The articles also mention the historical context of conflicts between the Ashanti and the British, including battles at Essamacow, Effootoo, and Doodowah, which resulted in losses for the Ashanti. Furthermore, the articles highlight the political fragmentation within the Ashanti Kingdom, with states like Adansi, Becqua, and Juabin seeking to secede and align with the British Protectorate, suggesting that British intervention contributed to the weakening of Ashanti's centralized power. The mention of the Ashanti King seeking help from the British and the hope for a unified Gold Coast under British rule further underscores the transformative effects of British intervention on the Ashanti Kingdom. These details align with the claim by illustrating the military and political consequences of British actions on the Ashanti Kingdom.


HH: The portrayal of Kumasi and its decline:

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the portrayal of Kumasi and its decline. The text describes the significant military defeat of the Asante by the British in 1874, which led to the disintegration of the Asante empire and the weakening of Kumasi's political power. The Treaty of Fomena forced Asante to recognize the independence of its vassal states, further contributing to the decline. Additionally, internal conflicts, such as the civil war between Kumasi and Dwaben, exacerbated the situation, leading to further fragmentation and the eventual deposition of the Asantehene. The text also highlights the influence of European colonial interests and the strategic maneuvers by the British to prevent the revival of the Asante empire. These details align with the claim of Kumasi's decline, illustrating both external pressures from European powers and internal strife as contributing factors. However, the text does not provide a detailed portrayal of Kumasi's cultural or economic aspects during this period, focusing primarily on political and military events. This absence of cultural and economic context could be seen as a difference in the portrayal of Kumasi's decline.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide a detailed portrayal of Kumasi, emphasizing its decline over time. The articles describe Kumasi as a small town compared to other cities in the region, with its population significantly affected by war and other factors. Historically, the population was estimated to have never exceeded 15,000 residents, although it could swell to 80,000 during grand occasions. However, since the 1874 expedition, the population has diminished, possibly to as low as 5,000, with an additional 10,000 from surrounding villages. The articles highlight the town's lack of defensive walls, relying instead on natural barriers like the Subin swamp and surrounding forest. The decline is evident in the physical state of the town, with once well-maintained roads now overgrown and many houses in ruins. The desolate appearance is attributed to the fall of many chiefs and the lack of reconstruction of their compounds. The articles also note the deterioration of the palace and the once-noble streets, now filthy and neglected. The presence of hawks, crows, and vultures is mentioned, suggesting a continued association with past violence. Overall, the articles support the claim of Kumasi's decline, providing a vivid depiction of its past glory and current state of neglect.


HH: The influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society:

	 - From GHA: The General History of Africa textbook provides several details that support the claim regarding the influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society. The text highlights the central role of the Golden Stool, a mystical symbol of unity and authority, which was deeply intertwined with the Asante's political and social structure. This indicates the integration of traditional beliefs into the governance and identity of the Ashanti. Additionally, the text describes the Asante's reliance on traditional religious practices, such as the swearing of oaths and participation in ceremonies, which were fundamental to the state's machinery and justice system. The influence of traditional religion is further emphasized by the resistance to colonial rule, where Africans, including the Ashanti, used their religious beliefs as a form of resistance against European oppression. However, the text also notes the impact of external religions like Islam and Christianity, which introduced new dynamics into the traditional religious landscape, although the traditional beliefs remained resilient. Overall, the textbook supports the claim by illustrating the pervasive influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society, while also acknowledging the interactions with other religious influences.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the influence of traditional beliefs and practices in Ashanti society. Firstly, the refusal of the Quocofocoos to serve under Koffee Carry Carry, despite their willingness to serve the golden stool of Ashanti, highlights the importance of traditional leadership structures and the people's resistance to a ruler who has violated customary norms by killing principal chiefs. This indicates a strong adherence to traditional authority and practices. Additionally, the mention of the Chief taking a "fetish" to keep the peace and open roads further underscores the role of traditional spiritual practices in societal governance and conflict resolution. The narrative also includes an Ashantee man seeking protection from execution due to a quarrel with a "fetish woman," illustrating the significant influence of spiritual figures and beliefs in personal and legal matters. Furthermore, the chief at Bogyawai expresses a desire to convert to Christianity but fears the King's retribution, indicating the powerful hold of traditional beliefs and the King's authority over religious practices. These observations collectively suggest that traditional beliefs and practices are deeply embedded in Ashanti society, influencing both political and social dynamics.


HH: The challenges of travel and communication in the region:

	 - From GHA: The "General History of Africa" textbook provides several details that are associated with the challenges of travel and communication in the region. The construction of infrastructure such as railways, roads, telegraph lines, and harbors by colonial administrations is highlighted as a significant development, although primarily aimed at facilitating the evacuation of exports rather than improving general welfare. This infrastructure, completed by the 1930s, was crucial for movement and communication, yet its role in 'opening up' the continent is noted to be exaggerated, with limited areas served and few inter-colonial links established. The text also mentions the reliance on human porterage for land transport before the colonial era, indicating significant challenges in travel and communication. Additionally, the integration of the eastern African hinterland with the coast involved the transformation and assimilation of pre-existing regional trading networks, suggesting that travel and communication were complex and evolving processes. These details align with the claim by illustrating the historical challenges and developments in travel and communication within the region.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the challenges of travel and communication in the region. The narrative describes the difficulties faced due to the rainy season, which made rivers impassable and roads muddy, significantly impeding travel. The need to wait for the King's messengers and the delays in receiving responses highlight the slow and unreliable nature of communication. The articles also mention the necessity of navigating through narrow and newly cut paths, indicating the lack of established infrastructure. Additionally, the presence of a guide with a peacock's tail and the ceremonial nature of interactions with the King suggest that cultural protocols could further complicate communication and travel. These details align with the claim by illustrating the logistical and cultural challenges faced by travelers in the region during that period.


HH: The role of outsiders or Europeans in influencing local customs and politics:

	 - From GHA: The paragraphs from the "General History of Africa" textbook provide substantial evidence supporting the claim that outsiders, particularly Europeans, played a significant role in influencing local customs and politics in Africa. The text highlights how European colonial rule led to the loss of sovereignty for African states, the imposition of fixed colonial boundaries, and the transformation of political maps, which disrupted traditional political and economic interactions among African communities. European colonial administrators, despite their intentions of 'native paramountcy,' established authoritarian systems that did not confer political power to Africans, as seen in the examples of Algeria and South Africa. The colonial system also introduced new social and political structures, such as the tax system and indirect rule, which altered traditional African institutions and governance. Furthermore, the cultural imposition of colonialism, including the spread of Christianity and Western education, led to changes in local customs and social structures. The text also notes the varied African responses to these influences, with some communities embracing Western innovations while others resisted. Overall, the textbook provides a detailed account of the profound impact of European colonialism on African societies, aligning with the claim that outsiders significantly influenced local customs and politics.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide several details that support the claim regarding the role of outsiders or Europeans in influencing local customs and politics. Firstly, the narrative describes a European's intervention in local customs, specifically in preventing a human sacrifice by appealing to the King, which indicates an influence on traditional practices. Additionally, Captain Lees' interactions with local communities, such as the Quocofocoos and the people of Konton-Assie, demonstrate an outsider's involvement in political matters. He attempts to mediate between the King and these communities, advising them to maintain peace and open roads, although he acknowledges his inability to force compliance. This reflects a European presence in political negotiations and conflict resolution. Furthermore, the mention of Captain Strahan's preference for Cape Coast over Elmina and Accra for governmental purposes suggests European influence in administrative decisions. However, the articles also highlight limitations to this influence, as seen in Captain Lees' inability to enforce the King's decrees and the refusal of local chiefs to submit to the King's demands. Overall, the articles illustrate both the active involvement of Europeans in local affairs and the constraints they face in altering entrenched customs and political dynamics.


HH: The depiction of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence:

	 - From GHA: The provided excerpts from the "General History of Africa" textbook do not directly address or depict Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence. Instead, the text focuses on various aspects of African history, including political domination, resistance movements, cultural resilience, and the impact of colonialism. Kumasi is mentioned in the context of the Asante empire, particularly regarding political sovereignty and the influence of Islam, but there is no mention of human sacrifice or violence specific to Kumasi. This absence of information related to the claim is a notable difference, as the textbook does not support or refute the depiction of Kumasi in such a manner. An expert historian might find this lack of direct evidence or discussion on the claim significant, as it suggests that the textbook does not emphasize or corroborate the portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence.
	 - From TAT: The African Times news articles provide a depiction of Kumasi that strongly supports the claim of it being a center of human sacrifice and violence. The articles describe Kumasi as a place where the "fiat of death" was a daily occurrence, and the palace is referred to as the "head-quarters of human sacrifice." The narrative emphasizes the "natural ferocity or superstitious dread" of the chief occupant, suggesting a culture steeped in violence and ritualistic killings. The articles also mention the "perpetual smell of human blood and putrifying human flesh," reinforcing the image of Kumasi as a site of gruesome practices. Furthermore, the text highlights the destruction of Kumasi as a form of retribution and purification, indicating a moral judgment against the city's violent history. These details align closely with the claim, portraying Kumasi as a notorious center of human sacrifice and violence. There are no significant differences between the claim and the content of the articles, as the articles do not provide any counter-narratives or mitigating factors regarding Kumasi's reputation.
