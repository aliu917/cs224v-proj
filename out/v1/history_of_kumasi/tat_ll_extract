{'document_title': 'THE MISSION TO KUMASI.', 'section_title': '', 'content': "In order to understand the revolution which is now occurring in Ashanti and the purpose of Captain Lee's mission to Kumasi, it will be necessary to consider for a moment the real nature of the kingdom which is or was governed by Calcalli, and if we trace it to its origin we find that about 200 years ago the Ashantees were a small tribe, vassals of Denkyera, then a powerful state, now part of our Protectorate. The Ashantees being ill-treated, rebelled, gained their independence, and founded Kumasi. They were surrounded by small kingdoms—Becqua, Kokofo, Mampom, Adansi, and Juabin—all of which they conquered; but these states still remained under their own kings, who paid tribute to the King of Ashanti, contributed soldiers when he went to war, attended the capital at certain festivals, and were summoned, as occasion arose, to councils, at which each chief or king spoke in turn, according to his rank. Thus it will be seen that the Ashanti nation was not homogeneous, but composed of various kingdoms which cherished the tradition of their independent sovereignty, which were held together more by the fear of punishment, and which were prepared at any time to secede from tyranny and taxation should any misfortune befall the imperial tribe. This seceding or separating process had already commenced before our troops were out of Ashanti. The Chief of Adansi and his people had been much oppressed by Ashanti. He resisted the white men, but as soon as Kumasi had been taken and the struggle decided he determined to throw off his ancient yoke and place himself in the hands of the stronger and also more merciful Power. He met Sir G. Wolseley in the ruins of Fomano, his own capital, and there made arrangements for migrating into the Protectorate. At the same time a rumour reached the General that the Chief or King of Becqua desired to follow the example of Adansi. Becqua is a powerful state, and its capital which our troops destroyed was not much smaller than Kumasi. Finally, the King of Juabin sent in his submission to Glorer, and afterwards began negotiations with the King of Eastern Akim, with a view to migration to that country. It seems that Becqua and Juabin have now determined to hold their own territory, to cast off their allegiance, and to resist any attempt that Calcalli may make to subdue them. Becqua is supported by Denkyera, and Juabin by Akim. Kumasi and its territory lie just between the rebellious states, and it is, to say the least, doubtful whether Kokofo and Mampom will assist the Ashantees, whose kingdom seems now reduced to its first elements—viz., a small tribe, a city which we may assume is not yet perfectly rebuilt, and a few plantation villages. It is, therefore, not surprising that the King should have sent to the white men for help. He says that he wants peace, and that war will be bad for trade; but as his messengers have passed without being molested through the Becqua territory, it is quite evident that these Becquas do not intend to be the aggressors. They were once free, they became slaves, and now they wish to be free again. Half a century ago, when Bowdich visited Kumasi, Juabin was an independent Power allied with Ashanti; and the early treaties with the English are in the joint names of Ashanti and Juabin. What more natural and laudable than that its chief should desire to regain the power which Ashantea craft and crime had taken from his ancestors? It is to be hoped that Calcalli will be made to understand that we do not deplore the misfortunes which his arrogance and exactions have brought upon himself, and that an attempt to subdue his rebellious vassals will meet with no sympathy from the British Government. A civil war in Ashanti would be injurious to trade, but it is not probable that the Ashantees will make war upon their neighbours. In the long run trade will certainly profit by the dissolution of the kingdom. If Ashanti had retained its ancient imperial power, war would have been the one occupation of that people, as it has been for the last 200 years. They might not have dared to invade the Protectorate, but they had plenty of other hunting grounds. Nor is it probable that the King would have ever made Ashanti a thoroughfare. Behind that country, to the north, are tribes rich in gold and cotton, who desire to reach the sea and trade with Europeans. It has always been the policy of Ashanti to check this enterprising spirit, and so to monopolize the trade. Kumasi was the *ne plus ultra* both for those who came from the north and those who came from the south; and so great was the dread of Ashanti among the neighbouring tribes, that I found in 1868, when I contemplated exploration from the Gold Coast and inspected the ground, it would be impossible to pass into the interior by any route between the Asini and the Volta without being arrested and sent to Kumasi. This cordon is now broken up, and it is probable that before very long the Germans and other tribes at the back of Ashanti will find their way down to the Coast.

Found low level hypotheses:
1. The Ashanti Kingdom was originally a small tribe under the control of Denkyera, but gained independence through rebellion and established Kumasi as its capital.
2. The Ashanti Kingdom was not a homogeneous entity but a collection of various kingdoms that maintained their own sovereignty and were held together by fear of punishment and taxation.
3. The oppressive rule of the Ashanti over its vassal states led to a desire for independence among these states, which were willing to secede when the opportunity arose.
4. The British military intervention and the capture of Kumasi weakened the Ashanti Kingdom, leading to the secession of states like Adansi, Becqua, and Juabin.
5. The dissolution of the Ashanti Kingdom could potentially benefit trade in the region, as it would open up routes previously controlled by the Ashanti and allow other tribes to trade with Europeans.
6. The Ashanti Kingdom's historical focus on war and territorial expansion hindered the development of trade routes and economic growth in the region.
7. The Ashanti Kingdom's control over trade routes prevented northern tribes rich in resources from accessing the coast and trading with Europeans, which could change with the kingdom's decline.
8. The British government was unlikely to support the Ashanti King Calcalli in his attempts to subdue rebellious vassals, as it would not align with their interests in promoting trade and stability in the region.
9. The historical alliances and treaties between Ashanti and other states, such as Juabin, were based on mutual interests, but these alliances dissolved as Ashanti's power waned.
10. The fear and control exerted by the Ashanti over neighboring tribes created a barrier to exploration and trade, which could be alleviated by the kingdom's fragmentation.

{'document_title': 'The Past, Present, and Future', 'section_title': '', 'content': "Sir,—As time goes by and brings its revenges, we do not mock at the present destruction of Kumasi by the British Government (although as individuals we have reason enough to do so), but we think the matter worthy of notice. June 15, 1807, was a sad time for the Fantees, especially of this town, with its near and remote neighbourhoods. Then, again, Sir Charles McCarthy arrived at the Coast some time in March, 1822, and on January 21, 1824, was fought the fatal battle, Essamacow. On May 21 of the same year, another battle was fought at Effootoo, and on the 11th and 13th of July, within sight of Cape Coast, another battle also was fought, with some loss to the Ashantees, by Colonel Sutherland. On the 26th of August, 1826, at Accra, in the plain of Doodowah, another battle was fought by Major Purdon, with a crushing loss to the Ashantees. After three or four years, negotiations took place between the Ashantees and the Protectorate (in 1830), under Governor Maclean. In 1853 the Ashantee force came, but returned, without making any attack. During this time, the Honourable Geo. Blankson was sent to Kumasi by the authorities at Cape Coast to open the roads for trade. He succeeded in this. In the year 1863 the Ashantee force came again, and battles took place at Essicoomah, and then at Bobicoomah. Since then, palaver goes, palaver comes, palaver goes, palaver comes, all the time, with some handsome presents sent up to Kumasi now and then to his Majesty the King by the merchants, with a view to cool his heart to open the path for business; but all to no purpose, and it ends with the war of 1873 and the present year, 1874.\n\nHad the monarch any idea that the time was so changed and unlike that the year 1874 would bring him and his kingdom a grievous, sufficient, and equal reply to the disaster of Essamacow in 1824, he would not have sent down his people into this Protectorate in such a manner. Had he known that after fifty years from Sir Charles' time, Kumasi also would be conquered and taken by the British Government, he would have learned wisdom and avoided the trouble which has now come upon him.\n\nOur reflection on these things, dear Mr. Editor, are, that Providence will yet make the whole Gold Coast, with Ashantees, &c., one country under the British Government; one flag, all brothers—only the wild King to be locked up, and let the people rest.—I am, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,", 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-04T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/30_04_1874#article-8', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.099}

Found low level hypotheses:
* The British military campaigns against the Ashanti Kingdom, culminating in the capture of Kumasi in 1874, were part of a broader strategy to consolidate control over the Gold Coast region.
* The repeated conflicts between the British and the Ashanti Kingdom from 1824 to 1874 reflect the persistent resistance of the Ashanti people against colonial encroachment.
* The British Government's destruction of Kumasi in 1874 was seen as a form of retribution for earlier Ashanti victories, such as the battle of Essamacow in 1824.
* The involvement of local figures, such as Geo. Blankson, in negotiations and trade initiatives suggests that there were attempts at peaceful coexistence and economic collaboration between the British and the Ashanti.
* The notion that Providence would eventually unify the Gold Coast under British rule indicates a belief in the inevitability of colonial expansion and the assimilation of diverse African societies.
* The reference to the "wild King" being locked up implies a perception of African leaders as obstacles to progress and peace under colonial rule.
* The ongoing "palaver" or negotiations between the British and the Ashanti highlight the complex and often tense diplomatic relations that existed alongside military confrontations.

{'document_title': 'KUMASI', 'section_title': '', 'content': "Kumasi (Coomassie), when compared with the towns in the Yoruba country and the immense cities of the Mohammedan kingdom which range from Senegambia on the west to Bornu far east of the Niger, is a small town. The exigencies of war have from time to time affected its population; but putting together what Bowdich, Dupuis, Freeman, and others have to say on this point, we should question if the actual average resident population of the Ashanti capital ever exceeded 15,000. The slaves of the chiefs for the most part live in the plantations, and when called in by their masters doubtless increased this number to the 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 which travellers often thought they saw. On the grandest occasions, when the tributary kings or high chiefs of Kukofu, Bekwai, Dwabin, Mampon, &c., were ordered to Kumasi, which occurred at least once a year, 80,000 is easily conceivable. Since the 1874 expedition, its numbers have been diminishing, and it is open to question whether there is now even 5,000, and adding to this its village populations 10,000, who properly belong to Kumasi. It has no wall and trench around it, like many of the cities above referred to. Nor does it require them. The Subin swamp and surrounding forest are an excellent protection, and with engineering skill, could make the place a very formidable stronghold. It is not until the stranger is within the town itself that he becomes really conscious of the fact that he is in Kumasi. It is not a city set upon a hill or placed upon a plain that is visible afar off. A few minutes after you emerge from the shades of the silent swamp, you find yourself surrounded by clusters of thatch-roofed houses and among a considerable population moving to and fro along well-beaten paths. The suddenness with which the traveller debouches upon the town is almost as abrupt as an unexpected change of scenes and actors upon a stage. Formerly these tracks leading straight into the main streets were good-sized, kept-clean roads. Now, the giant grasses and encroaching bush have narrowed many of them to mere sheep-walks. Once, lines of houses ranged along them; now those lines are broken into hundreds of places; and only here and there a roof rears its head among the tall stalks and marks their former site. In its glory, a bird's-eye view of the town would have described it as a vast collection of thatch-roofed compounds taking more of an oblong figure than any other. Its appearance now is that of a town, consisting of separate clusters of habitations, the densest being in the palace quarter. With the fall of scores of chiefs, whose households chiefly peopled Kumasi, there has been the fall of their houses. Whether they had successors or not, their spacious compounds have not been rebuilt. Wild convolvuli and all sorts of creepers vie with one another as if in haste to cover up the ruins. Hence the desolate, neglected, woe-begone appearance the place now wears. The stranger has no need to be told that at present it has no king, and that the last was too poor and disheartened to restore even a little of its faded glory. Those streets, once so many, so spacious, so clean, so much more noble-looking than other African streets, by reason of those most unique and handsomely decorated Dampans which adorned them, are now in many places filthy and despicable beyond description. Where the pigs do not snout it, nor the gold-seekers disturb it, or the friction of naked feet keep it bare, each street is left to look after itself. The Dampans are ornate house-frontages, verandah-like in that they are covered and open to the street; but are raised in dais form about three feet above the street, in order that the Ashanti magnate may observe and be observed of every one as he takes his haughty ease upon his throne. Of about 150 of these pretty buildings, about a score is left; but not one, we believe, is in perfect condition. Most of its fifty streets, with their curious nomenclature (Cook's, Horn-blower's, Executioner's, Drum's street, &c.), are doubtless still traceable even where the bush flourishes instead of wealthy chiefs' households. That famous market-place, that noble road that led from it to Bantama, along which, prophets say, no more triumphal armies will ever march with their ghastly spoils of victory—their pitiable state excites a sigh of sorrow, and half a prayer that even now Kumasi would see its folly, alter its policy, and make itself a prosperous mart for the extensive commerce of the vast regions beyond it. A grim idea possesses one as he sees that horrid appestiam, the charnel-house of beheaded thousands, rapidly encroaching upon the market-place—it that the innocent dead that lie there, heaps upon heaps, have vowed that that blood-shedding market-place shall be obliterated for ever. The palace, like everything else, is in several places tumbling down, and unless an energetic king is soon enthroned and sets upon repairing it, Kumasi's next monarch must build himself a new residence. It is not believed now that much innocent blood is spilled in the capital. Offenders are undoubtedly as summarily disposed of as ever, and, unquestionable authority says, in a public manner. Their slaves are so few in comparison with former days, their prospect for increasing them so hopeless, that they have to be very economical at the burial customs of even the great men, but a few of whom are left to bewail the fate of the nation. The immense number of hawks, crows, and vultures which still sweep round the town in ceaseless gyrations tempt one to be suspicious; but a moment's thought, that if they go elsewhere they fare much worse, explains why they still cling to the scenes of their former horrid feasts.", 'last_edit_date': '1886-01-01T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_01_1886#article-16', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.779, 'probability_score': 0.106}

Found low level hypotheses:
The population of Kumasi has fluctuated significantly due to the exigencies of war and political changes, with historical estimates often inflated by the presence of slaves and visiting chiefs.
Unlike other African cities with walls and trenches, Kumasi relied on natural defenses like the Subin swamp and surrounding forests, which could have been enhanced with engineering to create a formidable stronghold.
The decline of Kumasi is evident in the deterioration of its once grand streets and Dampans, reflecting the broader socio-political and economic challenges faced by the city.
The absence of a strong and wealthy king has led to the neglect and decay of Kumasi's infrastructure, suggesting that the city's prosperity was closely tied to its leadership.
Kumasi's strategic location and historical significance could have made it a prosperous commercial hub, but its failure to adapt and alter its policies has led to economic stagnation.
The historical practice of human sacrifice and its association with Kumasi's market-place may have contributed to the city's decline, both in terms of population and reputation.
The encroachment of nature on Kumasi's urban landscape, with bush and wild plants overtaking former streets and compounds, symbolizes the city's regression from its former glory.
The presence of hawks, crows, and vultures in Kumasi serves as a grim reminder of the city's past, where these birds thrived on the aftermath of human sacrifices and executions.
The description of Kumasi's decline and the remnants of its past glory highlight the importance of historical narratives in shaping the memory and identity of a place.

Human Sacrifices.', 'section_title': '', 'content': "Monday, April 1st, I began to think the King's messenger was making a fool of me by not returning with the King's answer; so I told the one who had remained behind that if he did not return during the day I should proceed to Kumasi the next morning. On Tuesday I therefore prepared to start, and, while so doing, was told that on account of the rains that had been pouring during the night, Ashantees on their way to Kumasi had had to return, because the rivers could not be crossed. I was told it was impossible to travel that day, and, not being able to help myself, said we must wait till the morrow. On Wednesday morning we left Bogyawai at six o'clock. We had travelled six hours when we again met two messengers from the King. He still said that we must remain at Bogyawai until Thursday week. I answered that this was impossible, that I should travel as far as Kasi, a village half an hour's walk from Kumasi, and that they must return to tell the King of it. I again urged that if the King detained me too long, I should be obliged to remain in Kumasi the whole of the rainy season, which I was determined not to do. The next day they brought me a message somewhat more satisfactory. I had permission to enter Kumasi on Monday. I had, therefore, to wait only three days at Kasi. Sunday evening, just as I was preparing for evening service, a woman was brought to me in tears and in great distress. She said she had come from Amoaful, for me to save her sister. The King had that day sent messengers to the chief, telling him that her sister, who was of the family of the King of Juabin, must be first sacrificed at the commencement of a custom just about to be kept for the slain chiefs during the war. She was already in log, and if I did not interfere she would soon be killed. The poor woman entreated so much, saying that she had a few days before seen her aged mother sacrificed, that I felt greatly moved. I sent for the King's two messengers who were with me, and told them I wished one of them to go to the King at once, and ask him for my sake to spare that woman. The King acceded to my request, a messenger was sent after the woman, and in three days she was brought to me in Kumasi. Her two children, one three years of age and the second a babe at the breast, had been taken from her, and she was very uneasy about them. After much difficulty I had them brought and restored to the mother the very day I left Kumasi. On Monday, April 10th, at nine A.M. we started for Kumasi. We were conducted into a new path recently cut through the bush, but by which I was told all Europeans had to enter Kumasi. This path brought us to the end of a long and wide street leading to the palace. Here we sat till we received intelligence from the King as to our future movements. After waiting half an hour, a messenger came to say that the King wished me to go to our lodgings, and take breakfast before the reception. I lodged in Prince Ansah's hut, which is quite near to the Mission grounds. Soon after our arrival some Elmina men, who had been some months trading in Kumasi, came to pay me their respects. They gave me a most horrible account of human sacrifices during the preceding week. There had been some every day, and the number on Saturday, when the King went to Bantama, was twenty-six! Sixteen were killed at Bantama, and when the King returned to town ten were killed in the market place. At three P.M. I was told the King was ready to give me a reception. Stepping out of doors, I was half-startled, but much amused, by being confronted by a foolish-looking fellow with a peacock's tail outspread on the top of his head, and covered with gold plates and ornaments from head to toe. In his hand was a gold-handled sword, which indicated that he was to be my guide. We followed him in single file, all my carriers walking before me. We were conducted through the market-place, then down another street, leading past the Stone Palace, now in ruins, then, turning to the left, went up another street, at the top of which is a large open space, where sat the King, his chiefs, with their captains, and numerous armed attendants; also the Queen-mother and a large company of women. They were all seated in a half circular line, each chief being under a large umbrella. I walked along the whole line, being introduced and shaking hands with all the chiefs and captains, more than one hundred in number. The King was seated about ten yards in the rear of the middle of the line, with a large number of attendants on either side of him. To him I simply raised my hat, while his attendants shouted his honours, even calling him the Possessor of Heaven and Earth. Having paid him my respects, I was conducted to another place, where I had to sit and receive theirs. They came in procession. Each of the chiefs was preceded by beating of drums and followed by armed men. They were carried in baskets on men's shoulders to within a few yards from me, when they alighted, and walked past me, each shaking hands. The scene became somewhat altered when the King approached. The tumbling and dancing and shuffling and shouting of those who went before him was almost bewildering, and rendered it almost impossible for me to keep my seat, and, fearing to be knocked over, I stood. It became more pleasant as these passed on, and the King's musical bands approached, followed by men carrying golden and silver bells, golden smoking pipes, and other jewels. Then came the King on foot, and surrounded by some fifty attendants. He wore a golden crown on his head, his body and arms were covered with gold ornaments, on each of his fingers were one or two massive gold rings, his sandals were richly decorated with gold, and round his waist was a most magnificent silk cloth. As he drew near he commenced dancing in a most wild and awkward manner,—men taking hold of his legs and holding his body, as if unable by himself to stand,—flung his arms about most curiously, and distorted the features of his countenance by making the most horrid grimaces. Just for one moment he smiled and waved his hand, then taking his sceptre from an attendant, signalled for the procession to move on. When the Queen-mother passed, I took hold of her hand to shake hands; two or three women caught them, and held them. I afterwards asked what this meant, and I was told it was to prevent my fetishes doing her any harm. It was seven o'clock when the reception was over, and I returned to my quarters.", 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-03T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.736, 'probability_score': 0.101}

Found low level hypotheses:
The passage suggests that human sacrifices were a significant part of Ashanti customs, particularly during times of war or important ceremonies. This raises questions about the cultural and religious significance of such practices in Kumasi and the broader Ashanti society.
The intervention of the narrator to save a woman from being sacrificed indicates that European visitors could exert influence on local customs and decisions. This claim could be explored in terms of how European presence affected traditional practices in Kumasi.
The passage describes a hierarchical political structure with the King at the center, surrounded by chiefs, captains, and numerous attendants. This suggests a complex system of governance and power distribution in Kumasi, which could be further examined.
The passage highlights interactions between Europeans and the Ashanti, including cultural misunderstandings and exchanges. The narrator's experience with the Queen-mother's attendants suggests a mutual curiosity and caution in these interactions.
The difficulty in traveling to Kumasi due to heavy rains and impassable rivers illustrates the challenges posed by geography and climate in historical Africa. This could be explored in terms of how such factors influenced trade, communication, and political relations.
The detailed description of the King's attire and the procession emphasizes the importance of wealth and symbolism in Ashanti royalty. This could lead to an exploration of how material wealth and display were used to assert power and status in Kumasi.
The presence of the Queen-mother and the involvement of women in the reception ceremony suggest that women held significant roles in Ashanti society. This claim could be investigated to understand the social and political roles of women in Kumasi.
The passage describes the use of music, dance, and elaborate processions during the King's reception. This highlights the cultural importance of these elements in Ashanti ceremonies and their role in reinforcing social hierarchies and traditions.

Purifying flame has passed over the gore-drenched soil. The palace—from which not only was the fiat of death diurnally issuing, but which was itself the head-quarters of human sacrifice, offered to gratify the natural ferocity or superstitious dread of its chief occupant, mined, blown up, and finally burned, is now, like the town, a heap of ruins. When Captain Sartorius, sent by Captain Glover to greet Sir Garnet Wolseley, passed through Kumasi, some days after the act of purification had begun, these ruins were still smoking, and not one living being was to be found there. The desolation was for the time complete. May it ever be so; for if the dying agonies of myriads of torturingly murdered human beings had a voice that reached to heaven, it was a spot to be for ever accursed, and against which vengeance could only have slumbered. We do not write against Ashanti as a conquering State—against its kings and chiefs as always thirsting for increased dominion and power. For characteristics such as these, we might equally denounce some civilized nations. We have denounced and do write against Ashanti, as a wanton shedder of human blood, for which it was ever athirst, which was its daily and hourly stimulant, and of which it would have drained the last drop from the Fanti countries, as it has done from many other interior ones, had not the protecting flag of Great Britain floated over the Castle at Cape Coast. That such a kingdom should be divested of the power it has hitherto possessed for gratifying such demon-like propensities, is surely a result that may well be regarded with satisfaction and rejoicing even by those whose principles are the most opposed to war. Kumasi has fallen! And here it is natural that we should draw attention to the ridiculous magnitude and importance which fear—fear of prisoners and visitors—had given to this blood-deluged town. Its population, though variously estimated, was by every one placed at a high figure; and yet all who have taken part in Sir Garnet Wolseley's expedition seem to agree that it could not have ever contained more than ten thousand inhabitants. We are not surprised at this. Kumasi could scarcely have been an attractive place of residence even for Ashantees. It was wanting in one very material point, and that is the element of security. The sacrifice of others, their torture, the perpetual smell of human blood and putrifying human flesh, may have been delicious; but the great human tiger was too near, and every man's life too much at his mercy, to allow of the enjoyment being satisfactory. We have, however, alluded to this scant population of a place reported to be very populous, principally to show how grossly exaggerated are the estimates of Africans, and even those of Europeans, when the objects are seen through the mists of native African fear and admiration. In conclusion, we must express the belief that there will be a new Kumasi, either on the old or on some new site, the latter being the most probable; and the hope that it may attain to and deserve a reputation diametrically opposed to that of the vile slaughter-house which has been so righteously destroyed.", 'last_edit_date': '1874-03-28T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/28_03_1874#article-3', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.718, 'probability_score': 0.099}

* The destruction of Kumasi was seen as a necessary act of retribution for the human sacrifices and violence associated with its leadership.
* The portrayal of Kumasi as a center of human sacrifice and violence may have been exaggerated by both African and European observers due to fear and admiration.
* The British intervention in Ashanti was justified as a moral obligation to stop the alleged atrocities committed by the Ashanti leadership.
* The fall of Kumasi was celebrated as a victory over barbarism, reflecting a colonial mindset that viewed African societies as needing European intervention for moral and civilizational improvement.
* The population estimates of Kumasi were likely inflated, suggesting that perceptions of its size and importance were distorted by fear and myth.
* There is an expectation or hope that a new Kumasi will emerge, potentially on a different site, with a reputation that contrasts with its past as a place of violence.
* The narrative of Kumasi's destruction reflects broader themes of colonialism, where European powers often depicted themselves as civilizing forces against perceived African savagery.

{'document_title': "CAPTAIN LEES' MISSION TO ASHANTI.", 'section_title': '', 'content': "On Captain Lees' return to Kumasi, the King complained of the Quocofocoos, and wanted Captain Lees to endeavour to bring them under his sway again. He went to the district, but in the meantime informed the King that, should the people refuse to come back to him, he could not force them, but only advise them to live in peace. On his arrival they vehemently refused to go under Koffee Carry Carry again; they said that they were ready to serve the golden stool of Ashanti, but that they object in toto to serve Carry Carry; that he had killed all the principal chiefs in the place, and consequently they would have nothing more to do with him. Captain Lees told them that he could not force them to serve the King, but he made them take the oath that they would keep the peace, open roads, and leave off kidnapping. The King was very much disappointed on Captain Lees' return, but could not help himself. He then made a complaint against the people of Konton-Assie. It appears that whilst in the zenith of his power, and from what is called time immemorial, these people have sent to the King of Ashanti every morning, with the exception of two days in the week, fresh river fish; now they refuse to make the usual supply and to serve him. This pains Carry Carry very much; and without them he cannot get such a good supply of fish as heretofore. Captain Lees undertook the journey to this place, and saw the Chief. The road was one of the worst that it is possible to imagine. The Chief refused to have anything to do with the King of Ashanti. He told Captain Lees to look at his village, how it was overgrown with weed; that since Carry Carry came to the throne he has taken all his people to go to war, and a great many have, in consequence, died; and he was not going to submit himself to such treatment again. He took fetish to keep the peace, open roads, and not molest the people of the King. The King was not very much pleased with this decision; but he has no power whatever to force his own decrees, and therefore must abide by it.\n\nThere seems to be some idea that, as the seat of Government, Captain Strahan prefers Cape Coast to Elmina and (there being no earthquakes here) to Accra.

Found low level hypotheses:
1. The authority of the King of Ashanti over surrounding regions, such as the Quocofocoos and Konton-Assie, was challenged and resisted by local chiefs and communities.
2. The refusal of the Quocofocoos to serve under King Koffee Carry Carry suggests a significant decline in his influence and authority, possibly due to his harsh treatment of local leaders.
3. The practice of sending fresh river fish to the King of Ashanti by the people of Konton-Assie indicates a long-standing tributary relationship, which was disrupted due to dissatisfaction with the king's rule.
4. Captain Lees' role in mediating disputes between the King of Ashanti and local communities highlights the influence and involvement of colonial powers in the internal affairs of African kingdoms.
5. The resistance of local chiefs to the King of Ashanti's demands reflects broader themes of autonomy and resistance against centralized authority in African history.
6. The mention of Captain Strahan's preference for Cape Coast over Elmina and Accra for the seat of government suggests strategic considerations in colonial administration, influenced by health and logistical factors.
7. The King's inability to enforce his decrees on the local chiefs indicates a weakening of centralized power in the Ashanti kingdom during this period.
8. The use of fetish (traditional spiritual practices) by local chiefs to ensure peace and open roads suggests the continued importance of indigenous belief systems in political and social agreements.

{'document_title': 'Journey to Kumasi, the Capital of Ashanti. Human Sacrifices.', 'section_title': '', 'content': 'I returned from Kumasi on Friday last, and now write to give you the particulars of the whole journey. I started from here on Thursday evening, March 23rd, intending to pass the night at Ekroful, at which place I was to find my full complement of Christian carriers. Mr. Mills, who accompanied me to Kumasi, did not start till the next morning. Mr. Mills having arrived at ten o\'clock on Friday morning, accompanied by Mr. Hayford, we started for Dunkwa. The people here are still rebuilding their houses, destroyed during the war; and, aided by the Committee\'s grant, are rebuilding their chapel. We stayed but a short time, and proceeded on to Idumasi, where we arrived at six o\'clock. The next morning we started at seven o\'clock, and after three hours\' travelling arrived at Mansu, where we halted for breakfast. I was struck with the camp-like appearance of this place. On either side of the wide road running through the village is a row of huts, erected so as to form a semicircle, giving the road within the village the appearance of a large circular yard. On the one side the huts are of bamboo, and are the residences of Houssa troops; on the opposite side they are built of swish, and belong to the natives. In the centre of the yard is a flagstaff, with the British flag waving at its top, and near it are a Mohammedan mosque and large bamboo shed, in the shade of which sat some twenty Houssa men. There being a table and forms under the shed, we were told that we might take our breakfast there. I had not been long seated before the Mohammedan priest came, and seated himself near me. I began a conversation with him, by asking the name of his native country. He said he came from Stamboul, and had been two years travelling from thence to the Houssa country. We then freely conversed on Stamboul and the nature of the road and countries he had passed through in his two years\' journey; and when he was in good humour for it, I asked him what he thought of Christianity. I then endeavoured to give him my reasons for believing that Christianity was the true religion, and that Mohammed was a false prophet. I believe an intelligent agent stationed at Mansu might do much good, not only among the natives, but among the Houssas. At ten o\'clock we left Mansu, and after four hours travelling arrived at Sutah. It being Saturday evening, we made the necessary preparations for resting on the Lord\'s-day. Sutah is a pretty little village, with over 500 inhabitants. It is built on a hill, and derives its name from its situation, being between two streams of water. On Monday morning, at an early hour, we left Sutah, and after nine hours\' travelling reached a village a short distance from the Prah, where we stayed the night. An Ashantee man here came to me in distress. He had had a quarrel with a fetish woman at Kokofu, and had abused her, for which cause the King had sent his executioners from Kumasi to put him to death. Having found a chance of effecting his escape, he had done so; and hearing that I was on my way to Kumasi, he came begging that he might accompany me, and that I might plead with the King for his life. I promised to do my best for him, at which he rejoiced like a man whose life had already been saved. At eight o\'clock, Tuesday morning, March 28th, we crossed the Prah. This was done in a large canoe, which is constantly being pushed across the river by Houssas with long poles. The road to the Prah is kept in good order, so that, with the exception of one river where the bridge is broken down, a carriage may be driven all the way. The numerous villages on the way have all been rebuilt, and several of them are as large as Ekroful. We found it very different on the Ashanti side. The path was narrow and very muddy, so that our progress in travelling, on the first day, was somewhat impeded. We reached Esiaman in the evening, a wretched village, in which we were glad to find a large bamboo shed erected for the use of travellers. The next morning we started at six o\'clock, having a long journey before us to reach Kwisa. After four hours\' travelling we arrived at Ekrofrum, where our men had hoped to find food for their breakfast. In this they were disappointed; for when we looked around for the village we saw nothing but bush and grass. There were Ashantees resting under the shade of a large tree, but there was nothing to be bought. Hungry and already much fatigued, they had to start on another five hours\' journey before reaching Kwisa. We arrived at the foot of the Adansi hills at two o\'clock. The zig-zag path up the hill made during the expedition is kept in good order, and renders the ascent up the steep part of the hill comparatively easy; but even now it is so fatiguing that we had to rest three times on the way. We were not sorry when we reached Kwisa at half-past three o\'clock. The carriers were so tired that they begged that we might rest here the following day, and as Prince Ansah had told me it was useless trying to enter Kumasi before the next Monday, this being the Adae week. I consented to it. On Wednesday, the 29th, the chief came to me and expressed his pleasure at having heard that we purposed establishing schools in Ashanti, and said that he and all the chiefs of Adansi were going to meet at Fomana to consider the subject, so as to let me know, on my return from Kumasi, where they would like to have their school. I said I should be glad to hear anything they had to tell me on my return. On Thursday morning we left Kwisa at six o\'clock, but we had not travelled more than three hours when we were met by two messengers from the King. The King was pleased to hear that I was coming; but during the whole of the next week he was going to keep custom, and then it would take him a few days to prepare to give me a reception. He therefore wished me to stay at Kwisa until that day two weeks, when he would send for me. This message astonished me greatly. As it had been raining every night since I left Cape Coast, the rivers were fast swelling, so that I was afraid of being detained in Ashanti till after the rains. I mentioned this to the messengers, and said I could not go back to Kwisa, but would proceed to Bogyawai, and would stay there till they returned to the King, to inform him that it was impossible for me to remain two weeks on the road, at this season of the year, and come back with the King\'s reply. One of the messengers had orders to remain with me to watch my movements, and to see that the natives attended to my wants; the other returned with my answer to the King. We arrived at Bogyawai at ten o\'clock. The people were very kind, and the chiefs and head men were constantly with me, and I ceased not speaking to them on things pertaining to their everlasting salvation. On one occasion the chief said, "Do you mean to say that we are to escape the everlasting fire you speak of and enter heaven only by forsaking our sins and receiving the death of Jesus as our sacrifice?" I answered, "Yes, that is just it." "Well," said he, "I do hope that you will succeed in obtaining from the King permission for us to become Christians, for it is a good religion, and I wish to be happy after death, and I shall be the first to be a Christian in this place; but it cannot be now, for the King would kill me." This was said in the presence of a large number of people. My stay at Bogyawai was very interesting. One day all the sick came to me for medicine. I told several that I had no medicines with me to suit their cases, but they would have such as I had; which gave them each a dose of *purgative saline* or of *Epsom salts*, which satisfied them. One man had a cold in the head; I told him to wrap himself up well at night, and sweat it out. This amused him exceedingly. He could not believe that old could get into a man like that, for he felt cold he warmed himself by the fire, and all the cold left him. No argument could convince them that...\n**[AUGUST 1, 1876.]**', 'last_edit_date': '1876-05-03T00:00:00', 'url': 'https://history.genie.stanford.edu/issue/01_08_1876#article-21', 'num_tokens': 0, 'block_metadata': None, 'similarity_score': 0.715, 'probability_score': 0.099}
